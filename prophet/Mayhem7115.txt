Is spellstrike hood for the set bonus really worth sacrificing 3% crit dmg from the meta gem? Anyone done the math on that?
So best case youd wear t4 helmet and shoulders for the set bonus, rest individual pieces?
Ty @Korvo what is it with meta gem not being out tho?
Anyone know if blade of wizardry has inner cd? On my pserver it didnt so it was super broken for bombing
Oh it says in the tooltip rip
Nvm tooltip is retail
If meta is in its t4 head and shoulders imo and FSW robe
Does anyone know if there will be changes to the vendor for the rod formulas? They have a damn long respawn timer and everyone needs them, especially runed adamantite rod
yes, but aldor has the superior shoulder enchant
minmaxers exist that arent clearing naxx because honestly wbuff stacking classic content is a bit of a joke to minmax
in the first weeks a lot of things seem a lot more attractive than doing naxx (outside of raids) like farming formulas/patterns/recipes
who cares if imp is in danger if you literally cant apply fire dmg to alar 😛
in 10 years of TBC pservers I havent seen anything other than shadow destro be successful so thats what Ill run, if something else proves superior Ill adapt
why am I orange parsing everything as shadow destro I thought it was declared shit early 🙂 ?

25%
such luck
Real talk: Reached #4 world on opera playing shadow destro (Gas / Lucifron), I had good support but 0 TBC craftable items and 0 classic items. #1 server curator #4 Maulgar with shit timed heroism. Quote me on this fire is quite literally hot garbage, dont waste time and resources on spellfire, just go shadow if you dont hate dealing damage, also forget about that immolate bs when playing shadow destro. My brutally honest opinion.
Sims are not the game
I listed 3, apart from that I have 10 years of TBC pserver experience and everything happening so far is confirming what happened there
Just a few weeks
I'll see you guys
In the distance
From my rear mirror
People shit on me for statistics, look at my logs, Look at my gear, look at the facts. Even in wipes I shaved cleaner than Gilette Mach 3. If 95% play fire because a cult said the sims said so, obviously not many shadow chads will appear in logs. Statistics dont stop existing just because they arent in your favor for once. The tables will turn. Latest when the  🤡 mages spec arcane to salvage their last bit of dignity, you fire boys will look like a 🤡 too.
playing fire destro is being inferior to a shadow destro like a fire mage just with extra steps
the reason why fire destro is inferior is because until the mage has 5 scorch stacks up our wall of 4 shadow destros (all orc) has already killed the target
even if you were to find a parallel universe in which fire is slightly superior right now (you wont), with t5 you can DE your spellfire because the mage 🤡  will play arcane, which will boost him more than scorch could be worth, in SSC and TK you switch a lot between SB and seed on trash for which use case shadow destro is the best choice, meaning even if you take the mage 🤡  out of consideration, what shadow destro can do is superior for overall cleartime of SSC and TK
immolate is damage loss
its not just mayhem back
#1 dps at moroes on the server is back
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Hkzv36VqKG78j9dA/#fight=28&type=damage-done
!shadowdestro
why play a spec that shouldnt be #1 anyway? I for one dont hate dealing damage
drag it out of bars
Ive seen it, decent idea, doesnt work
theoretically this theoretically that Ive seen people use immolate thinking theyre 5Head for years on pserver, the pure SB spammers were always above them
because the top players do what the cult thinks that the sims say, they are mislead, also the top players have gold and material resourcesresources, they appear on top in logs because theres not much else that could appear, I dont have shit not one craftable items not a single item from classic yet I already pwn the noobs, quote me on this within phase 1 I will parse a 100 in g/m because fire is nothing but one yuge bait
I'm already #1 wl on 3 bosses in kara on my server with way less to work with compared to other locks
If I dont parse a 100 on either gruul, maulgar or magtheridon within phase 1 you ban me from this server. If I do you mod me. Deal?
What exactly do you plan on doing as fire in t5 except being inferior to shadow? Your sac sucks half the time and you lose scorch. Please explain.
because arcane deals like twice the dps compared to fire
Ive mained mage on 3 different pservers Ive seen it all mount hyjal bombing arcane is like x1.7 fire at least, can even beat locks, better single target dps, they switch back only in sunwell
for ssc, tk, mh and bt arcane is the superior spec for overall raid dmg and the difference is big enough to warrant losing scorch
In T5 + BT generally for both trash and bosses you regularly run into situations in which you both seed and single target dps, that makes fire too inefficient because of sac. Morogrim, Hydross, Alar, Solarian, KT - all bosses with big time seeding. Then you have a lot of variance in trash aswell, unless your guild is a snail youd have a big problem keeping up correct sac as fire and packs you do both seed and single tar (ssc platforms, solarian room). All while cucking the mage for nothing. Thats why fire turns into a meme next phase.
Some dont have 50k gold banked and dont mind wasting gold on spellfire. T4 content is a meme you cant even speedrun properly. The game starts in T5 imo, thats what I prep for.
The point is P1 bis is easy to optain, only weapon could be unlucky. And that stuff is enough for shadow to pull ahead of fire so why even bother? My guild runs 4x orc shadow destro no immolate bs, sp in the raid. 3x resto sham for perma pump. Our purple wall will reign. Watch us.
Everyone is on the same page the immolating shadow destros could never reach the pure spammers. It gets worse and worse as the content goes on especially during bloodlust immolate is asking to be below 🤡 mage in dps and then you also have shit like soulfrost enchant not working for immolate and the short cast time causing more windows for latency dps loss.
Its not like they didnt try, they tried it and it simply produced imferior results
Our warlocks, one of them literally geared 3 warlocks to full BT bis, he has seen and tried it all. If you play perfectly which if you're the player "Gas" on Lucifron is reasonably achievable whats the difference between sim and game? Also while you immolate you cant apply ISB and thats the whole concept of our purple wall. The more chad sb only shadow destros the more stacks to hit into. Btw 250 haste isnt even that much youll reach it P3.
:brain:
the second you get 2 set t5 as a mage you should be arcane, in fact you should even prep some gear before that moment
the fire mage will not catch up until swp, in swp fire mage is superior because arcane is stuck with that old gear and cant deal with all the haste and long fights of swp
yup, almost as bad as the fire thing
this is just the start, I kinda feel bad for people who got baited by the cult into spellfire but maybe they can acquire some enchanting skill points with the void crystals
!shadowdestro
if we live in a simulation how are logs not simulation?
it only needs to be in the raid, if your raid doesnt bring an spriest its a bit of a 🤡 move
Perfect comp features 4 shadow destros, means pretty good uptime
3 get an extra 8% crit from group support, yes a moonkin is supposed to be brought for improved ff
I had a 6.8k crit on Maulgar last id with pretty unspectacular gear, fire is donezo
Not just that unless your raid moves very slowly you lose combat uptime so only if you're in a 🤡 guild you're fine playing the 🤡 spec that is fire, it will fall heavily out of favor in T5 and be entirely forgotten by T6
Alar you also seed
So why is there pinned misinformation about the relative power of shadow destro in future content?
First thing to do each day: find tank for SP HC
Group happens to be in dire need of melees
At least jump failers can be summoned
Go for 2p T4 via head and shoulders and wear spellstrike pants
just play shadow destro, demo is 🤡 and fire is cult bait
shadowcloth tends to be cheaper too, for now
Imo dont socket yellow hit, green quality spellhit doesnt exist and blue is like 100g on my server at least, at that point might aswell invest the gold in craftable pieces, there are many items with hit in the game, by sunday I had 163 hit
If gold wasnt a consideration socket yellow hit until 164
Also go mecha HC every single day for marks and organge spell/spellhit sockets that drop there, do it while melees still delude themselves into thinking they need abakus trinket
The viability ends so early that they were a meme on pservers, seeing one is like seeing a ret paladin in classic or a male draenei hunter, just why bro?
Coordinate with guild warlocks about your spec, if you are the only aff its fine at least until the melee dmg reduce stops mattering and shadow destros start to seriously pull ahead to the point where your support cant make up for the personal dps loss
I just trust more what I've seen than the sims. Sounds esotherical at first, but its not like I only played on one small pserver. That would mean maybe the server got something wrong with the class mechanics or the player pool was so small that the wrong meta emerged. My experience was the same on different ones and throughout many years, also the same with arcane mage vs fire mage (this discussion impacts warlock choice). People also calculated to use immolate as shadow destro, then they experienced inferior results and stopped using it, albeit some sticked to it because they would rather deal slightly less damage than accept that the numbers are lying. My guild transferred from TBC pserver to retail TBC Classic and spec is not a question for any of the warlocks. We run 3x shadow destro and 1x aff, the aff gets to chill in the non ele/boomkin group while the others pump like crazy. We dont have classic gear and are kinda broke but everyone plays the optimal race (4x orc wl) like the rest of the guild except the 🤡 rogue for pvp (yes we bring a rogue because he carries dps in t6/t6.5). So what Im saying is we do what we're doing based on the experience we have and if that experience turns out to betray us I guess we'll adapt but for now experience weighs more for us than numbers we knew anyway, its a different approach, one that is harder to choose if you lack the pserver experience but I think one most would choose in our situation.
I dumpstered him on Gruul pretty big time look at all fights consider death in last one

I dont even have full gear yet the 🤡  fires are getting pwned
this is just the start
I dont even have full crafted gear or a meta socket and my raid is full of noobs yet Im catching up faster than you can DE your spellfire
you fires are getting smaller and smaller
in my rear mirror
when is this misleading 🤡  information getting unpinned?
the nature of t5 makes fire unviable, it will be beaten by shadow for most bosses and overall dps
this is the problem with this discord
noone knows dogshit
half the bosses in t5 include seeding
you dont just seed then you single target again, and lose
because demo isnt more dmg
!shadowdestro
u have to kill maulgar first for parse its stupid
u dont doom on maulgar because ur raid needs to focus down maulgar for parse
I managed a decent parse still with a 2 min fight and got off 2 dooms on maulgar, but probably wont see a 2 min fight again because of raid getting better
if u actually want a good parse on hkm you need to ask the raid to focus down maulgar making it a 20 second fight
our fight was 2 min + yet I reached a 99 and Im #1 allstar wl server, #75 world, we dragged along some really dead bodies yet youre getting beaten by shadow, youre getting smaller and smaller in my shadow destro rear mirror
Keep lookin at kara parses lul
literally cant read
if u wanna own the world u have to own the server first because if u own the server the whole player pool belongs to you, people dont look for other guilds if they already are in the best guild on the server

"play shadow destro if you hate dealing dmg"
- this discord
Any headpiece that can fit a metagem for csd is better than full spellstrike
I mean we got 3x 99 on Gruul and 3x 99 on Mag tonight with the shadow destros shitting on immolate also idk how thats troll
The cult is blowing up
So we 1) arent fire 2) dont use immolate how are we stacking 99s even then? It should make more than 1%. The general advice should be to stack shadow destro we have 2 shadows eating stacks it doesn't matter also we dont rely on the 🤡 mage, until he built scorch stacks on Maulgar/Mag the mobs are dead and arcane is already the stronger spec anyway even without 2p t5, fire is extra steps for NOTHING
Fire doesn't even gain what mages lose by having to play their 🤡 + spriest support not happening with fire, im talking here and now fire is DONEZO, the numbers prove it
We have 10 years of TBC pserver experience and you dont, the admins are breaking their own rules with the information presented, 99% of guilds are best off just stacking shadow destros
Also I dont get how people act like mage getting innervate is a cheese move or something, your 5 healers that press first mana pot when they realize they cant cast anymore rely on it? Im sorry. Innervate is a part of arcane mage basically, so the raid shouldnt bring more than 2, also good raids bring double feral anyway because warrior is crap, so enough innervates for everyone.
Our mage is a 🤡 lamentably
Thats how it plays with t5 good arcane beats WL get used to it
1 innervate which the raid can afford 1 spriest which the raid has anyway
People just cant handle the real talk thats why as an empathic human being my appearances on this discord have become more sporadic
Using in 2021 in 2021
Its cringe to assign special value to legs every 2nd player has
mage should not play fire in p3 arcane is stronger in p3
in hyjal provides like twice the bombdmg and bossfights are short, not debatable, black temple its more close
you can ice block it
and even if they were to go afk for that boss, arcane mage bomb dps is insane (competitive with warlock) and thats like 90% of hyjal, the other bosses are also very short fights which always favors arcane, just archimonde may be more convenient for fire kinda depends on how the raid does
mage 4p t6 bonus is sure nice for fire, but in return arcane mages dont have to make compromises to get the 4p setbonus, just for their 2p (4p t5 incredibly strong too though)
in black temple except for council, where the mage may be tanking anyway, the longer fights illidan and reliquary have transitions for the mage to regen, gurtogg may be the worst fight for arcane because its reasonably long with no breaks, in general the stronger the raid is the better for arcane because it doesnt suffer from long boss fights
in swp fire is definitely better because of the inflation of haste rating which is great for fire and doesnt do much for arcane
at the start at least, youd rather have the innervates for your healers when progressing, but I wouldnt be surprised if arcane starts resurging just because of kill times getting ridiculous
there is quite some haste already in p3 (especially due to haste sockets) but it just doesnt change that arcane outclasses fire at bombing and still deals more dmg when mana doesnt become too much of an issue, it also depends on what is important for the raid and how many mages the raid brings, for example if the raid aims for fast overall clear time and there is just 1 mage in the raid, it would be a pain for the mage to be fire for black temple overall dps, because there are many medium sized trash mobs that are half dead once youre done stacking scorch
Oh interesting
thats because my guild disbanded but it seems to me my prophecies were 100% accurate
I joined a more casual guild because Im playing with my gf so I cant play in a more hardcore guild because they would kick her, and what Im seeing in this more casual guild (casual as in they are fine only being top 10 on the server, not like full on casual) is that the warlocks got baited into playing fire by the guide writing cult when really they should have been playing shadow from the start, now that Ive converted most of the warlocks in this guild there is a guy who refuses to change because he doesnt want to let go of the fire pieces he crafted
their warlocks were in shambles when I joined, they struggled to even be in the top 10 of dmg dealing characters within the raid (with what was above them being questionable aswell) it was basically germany in 1945 but worse, now that Ive joined warlocks are topping the meters like they should, at the start I was the only shadow warlock but despite not having any other shadow chads to support me with isb stacks I owned the fire dogs, that way I convinced them to change and join me in being a superior warlock player, only one fire warlock is left in the raid now, its a miserable case of casual player, he doesnt even get to play with ele shaman and moonkin anymore because the leadership decided to punish his ignorance and put him in the healer group, he landed in the trash can of the raid setup where he belongs
honestly the hardest part is people killing trash that takes 6 seconds to kill while you could just skip it
its to establish dominance within the raid group
alright
before the great cleansing: https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/PwtCGg81mdazTq9J#fight=8&type=damage-done
after:  https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/GwBHqYJFyQtr2a9A#fight=6&type=damage-done
there are various sorts of cleansings this raid group required and still requires, for instance until recently the setup featured a frost mage
34.7%, 1 bloodlust
btw I dont have 2p t4 because im very unlucky
Ive cleared every single id of t4 since the leveling week and I havent seen drop even once: t4 shoulder token, t4 head token, prince caster cape
literally not once
you have to tell anyone that isnt wearing vashj robe in p3 to piss off from looting it in p2, they will get kaz pants anyway
until they put on t6 chest in the next phase anyway
bracers? you can just craft better ones next phase
belt of blasting too, but that one is just a matter of gold
there are only 2 items that are BOTH 1) still bis in p3, 2) aids to get and those are vashj robes and solarian wand
no if you have a full raid of tryhards you will have a wall of 99s even if personally you have slightly below average luck
while you are casting anything that is not called shadow bolt you are lowering the uptime of isb for everyone involved
that is the way
unlucky warlocks drain it too
im not joking, look at the ISB uptime in your logs, anything below 100% has to be improved
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/aLZdzXpcf9yhkJc2QU1YE8 my non immolate casting bis list for next phase, anyone got suggestions for improvement?
I found that t5 legs > spellstrike pants because theyre basically the same item except a load of stam and int on the t5 piece and wearing spellstrike resulted in a surplus of 2 spellhit that couldnt be made use of by swapping gems/items
well the stronger purple gems are already in other items
rp reasons maybe? fire otherwise is just aids, the bombing feels whack and is way inferior, it also feels bad to kill medium sized trash mobs because you have to decide between stacking scorch for very little use or not stacking it at all
Does anyone have a different p2 list than the one on wowhead? I cant believe that list to be the best options, prince cape inherits more value than sunstriders cloak and the gemming is missing out on 1 sp
Im just looking for ideas Ive built different things with different results
swapping to sunstriders from prince cape is saying that 14 spell > 18 hit, at the same time they have to socket for hit and in socket values hit is harder to achieve, just doesnt add up
I realize spell/hit gems are the most value for gems, but if you can socket 9 spell instead of 5 spell 4 hit because of wearing prince cloak instead of kael cloak, you overall won more value
but in that case it makes even less sense to inclue sunstrider cloak in a bis list no?
here and now like 70 out of top 100 mages on gruul are arcane, if the fight is short enough arcane wins already now
I just found out that one of the warlocks in my new 🤡  guild has been casting rank 10 shadowbolt and rank 7 shadowburn for every single raid in TBC including yesterdays ssc, this beats the movement speed meta gem as the worst thing about this warlock
engi helmet came out as not that much of an upgrade when I simmed it, because you have to sacrifice FSW boots which are kinda > BoB, still like 3 dps better though
with FSW boots you go prince cloak which contains more value than other cloak options
obviously you cant drop tailoring until vashj robes anyway because FSW chest ist chad and fire a fucking meme
quite a bit
exactly
double icon is like super slightly worse than icon + quag but that only applies if you are 100000% certain you dont have to move your character so basically never
but if you want to farm 99s just to look good quag is BIS because it has the less consistent outcomes
warlocks should place seed on moro not the adds, maybe thats a thing they arent doing
if both "methods" executed properly then no, but I imagine dads when tabbing through murlocs losing uptime and they may die with weird hp % left
ruby drape is bis
wrong
literally doesnt

it allows to use pure spell gems, which arent the most efficient gems, but because the item contains so much value that doesnt even matter
yeah and drape allows you to change them to red
and it sims better
using all of them
I literally admitted to pure spell gems being less efficient and still ruby drape sims better because of the changes it allows
18 hit is more valuable than 14 spell, what should be blatantly obvious anyway sims better by 2.5 dps, drape + red gems = more value than sunstriders + orange gems
without ele
guild leave button is bis
I bring arguments and you dont even have any except ad hominem?
drape is literally 3 spell stronger than sunstriders if all you do is switch the gems and the cloaks, all drape loses is 1 point of intellect which is a joke
how can I link sim string if its like 5k more characters than allowed?

I mean, you dont even have to sim it, Im literally using all of the items everyone is using anyway, except for running drape and in exchange swapping orange for red gems, and it adds up to 3 spell more at the cost of 1 point of intellect. This is with drape: https://seventyupgrades.com/set/cwMfp5oXJbN3WDqwZe2VXn this is without https://seventyupgrades.com/set/icMwDKVfuoGYFUtGfwi8Fp
you even end up with one more point of spellhit than youd need
I dont know what kind of gem sorcery has to be performed to change drape being 3 spell stronger than sunstriders if you use it to remove the orange gems required when running sunstriders, it should straight up be stronger unless youre using an item that changes everything
I used 2 green hit gems and mecha gem
one is in the head one in the belt
yeah for when using drape
the drape one uses 1 green only and using any more would do nothing because there are no more slots where a red gem would even fit, but that is not the one to be improved because it results in 3 spell more, the one with sunstriders that needs the most efficient hit gemming it can get is using 2 green hit gems
I will just farm an unholy amount of gold and hopefully buy it off the ah or at least get it in a trash run, rather than having to worry about which way the guild will screw me over
What do you think the ah price of belt of blasting will be 3 weeks from now?
You kinda need a prot for archimonde, other than that all they do is produce shit threat
Our prot is luckily gearing his feral as we speak, he saw it coming
maybe the engineering goggles are like 7 dps better than t5 helmet, but also in many cases looting the t5 helmet will have implications for the personal situation within the loot system, allowing the goggles wearer to grab actual loot faster, so crafting the googles in reality is a bigger boost than one might first think
the hardest boss will be non hardcore guilds trying to clear BT+Hyjal in 1 week while also not having the time to farm the items from previous content that remain strong
for warlock vashj robes and solarian wand remain bis, solarian wand is not the end of the world if you dont get it, vashj robes is a pain in the ass if you dont get it, also more casual guilds run the danger of distributing these items not efficiently, then theres the belt from vashj, hydross shoulders, void reaver rogue trinket, tsunami, arcanite steam pistol (rogue), thalassian wildercloak for feral, twinblade for hunter which remain BIS
the T6 chest is shit unfortunately, if youre forced to use it you use Kaz legs and every single caster apart from warlock needs them
thats why guilds should prio warlock on vashj robes, its better for them and then kaz legs are less contested
Ive gotten sola wand in the first id and Im really happy with it, means I have nothing from TK to super sweat about for the rest of the game
rogue and hunter with some swp gear should easily deal more single target dmg
I have found that JC sims about 1.5 dps better than engineering. This while JC is also being used in P3 and P4 due to the T6 head piece being mandatory. Imo this makes engineering recommendation (after crafting BoB) kind of a bait.
true
Why is everyone talking about BoB when boots of the shifting nightmare sim better (even when using immolate)?
they sim 2.5 dps better for me than BoB
I found that they sim basically exactly the same when having 1 bloodlust only, but in my raid I get 2 BL
100k
im using custom ISB uptime of 70%
I dont believe 70% ISB uptime to be optimistic when what Im simming is P2 bis gear, by the time I actually have that gear the crit% of all warlocks in the raid should have improved by quite a bit compared to now, and we are already easily getting above 60% for high uptime bosses and thats with one idiot still running fire
also I just simmed with 65% and it didnt change a thing anyway, equal with 1 BL, shifting winning with 2 BL
well bis gear achieves almost 42% crit raidbuffed and then you also have twilight owl chain existing bumping it to almost 44%, I believe 4 warlocks at least achieving 40% crit is realistic
but the uptime didnt change a thing anyway, the number of BL seems to do
had my first regular 10k+ SB crit today, the real fun is just beginning
Apparently Ive joined an absolute clown guild
More clown than I initially thought it would be
This died when my guild died 😔
guess whos back in business
in t6 raids there is more incoming dmg for the healers to deal with, also items start having haste which is great for their output but bad for their mana, for hyjal its not much of a problem since you can regen during the waves, but imo the optimal setup for a fast and smooth black temple run includes 2 sp not just one, then you dont have to deal with the question who gets the sp, imo its better to (for example) have 4 healers actually playing the game rather than 5 acting like not having a sp under these conditions isnt a massive output loss
if youre bringing an additional healer so some healers can sit while chainpulling, you might aswell be bringing one less healer but one more shadow, thats a dmg gain not a dmg loss
correct but ultimately inappropriate advice for 99.9% of players caused the death of numerous dadguilds
https://i.redd.it/idurp3yqdi181.png
actulally I was ahead with what I was saying all along
the day youre in line for vestments and your guild stops caring about t5
in sunwell for the time you dont have a sunwell weapon the value of toc vastly improves due to lack of spellhit on sunwell items, also you may find your guild not running an ele shaman because ele shaman personal dps sucks gigantic balls in sunwell
not elemental shaman though
you just run as many resto shamans as you can, in terms of healing theres nothing other healers provide that resto shamans dont, but resto shamans have that 40 second op button
forward looking raids should prepare their elemental shamans to turn into resto shamans for sunwell (ele shamans have shit scaling, they run out of mana in sunwell encounters, they cant deal at all with spell pushback (warlocks due to being gods receive earth shield from the ele plebs that are now resto)), this means forward looking warlocks should prepare for not having additional 3% spellhit rating from ele shaman while also keeping in mind that in sunwell they will replace items that provide spellhit rating with items that provide other superior stats (for example t6 legs -> brutallus legs), meaning they should adapt their view on zhardoom vs toc + chronicle. zhardoom may be stronger in p3 and p4, in sunwell it is not, sunwell is a lot harder than any other tbc content and the first content in wow with dps checks above clown level, this means its rational to accept less dps in p3 and p4 if it means better performance in sunwell progress, items and time being limited means 99% of raids wont be able to distribute both weapon options to a player while not looking stupid as fuck, if your iq is higher than your parse (probably easy for most of you) then you will pick up toc + chronicle and sell that to the persons responsible for loot distribution as an act of unparalleled selfless sacrifice to the people that supported you along the way to killing illidan, just as a minor compensation you ask for skull of guldan which not only belongs to warlocks anyway, but also helps you with the spellhit rating implications of sunwell mentioned above
sup
zhardoom should have a 20% chance of dropping (total of 5 items on the table), even if its 24 ids, thats only 4.8 zhardooms and thats with average luck, with 4 zhardooms you at best have warlocks covered if you want to give it to warlocks, its not better for toc, then you may have people quitting the game or guild causing loss of items, guilds should choose wisely what they do with those weapons
fsw robes were by far still the best robes until vestments, when I got vestments I dropped tailor and was able to swap from t4 helm to gogs, this change overall improved my dps by more than 70
Has there been any new information on spellhaste gems appearing in p3 or not?
you replace bracers in p3 within days if you want so low prio on those, as long as you have vestments and wand you can sleep and parse well
yup https://discord.me/clowngang
if you dont have orc racial why are you even posting
sadly I had to create this in order to convince my guild to start properly using jewelcrafting necklaces (while theyre acting like using less than 15 destruction potions a raid is a crime)
destro pots has shit value for gold, this doesnt mean that they shouldnt be used but many use them while actually they should be taking a mana potion for better dps or while not using jc necks when they provide literally 10 times more value per gold
this is what the tables assumes, 3 min bossfight (many have about that length) 1 destro pot (shortly after pull), 1 mana pot (when ready)
is just the warlock player
what also isnt accounted for is that normally you wouldnt use destruction potions for trash but the neck buff stays active and trash is about just as important, more than half of the damage dealt in a raid is trash damage
most of the time I find more use in mana pots for trash
well most of the time mana pot deals more dmg on trash
I feel this on a personal level

epic spell/spellcrit gems sim worse than just rare spell gems
we had our first last week and our second this week too
how do you make use of the hit ros neck provides in full bis? all you have to do is use an orange spell/spellcrit gem in t6 legs and youll be at 164 spellhit rating using the pvp neck and that option is like 4 dps better still
I wouldnt take the cloak from healers its literally only 1 dps
it does
you take hyjal trash cloak which has hit
and with that you get exactly 164 hit when you put an orange gem for the socket bonus in legs or hands, that option sims literally 1 dps worse, I dont think 1 dps is worth robbing it from healers, illidari cloak is a worse tradeoff and more efficient on other casters
its not worth taking the illidari council cloak for using ros neck, the dps gain on arcane mage, elemental shaman and boomkin is higher because they lack the option of hyjal trash cloak
what does that have to do with anything? warlocks shouldnt take council cloak unless no mage, shaman or boomkin need it
other dps dps is not raid utility but dps
the build you linked contains a gemming error anyway, different gemming achieves 1 more dps
if you put potent pyrestone into t6 hands and legs (the one with spell/spellcrit) making use of both setbonuses you achieve 163 hit, which feels ugly but sims better to me in 500k iterations
ok well Im not done
these are my simulation results (500k iterations each), the nethervoid cloak makes use of the haste pvp necklace and the shroud and illidari council cloak make use of ros neck. only slightly different gemming in hands and legs for both options. I sim blasting shadow bolt only like usually, using curse of doom and finishing with shadowburn. I assume a custom ISB uptime of 75%. I assume fight length of 150 to 210 seconds because that sounds like a typical fight length to me. I assume 2 bloodlusts because my group always gets 2 bloodlusts. I assume JC necks active. No malediction in T6.
@Ryusei when I use your import it doesnt even change the dps number when I switch from 1 to 2 lusts
I will begin with sharing my setup then people can look themselves sec I will create
ok this is my setup
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/s25a5EvXatRa58gwePtSUC
change belt or boots
here once more with correct gems so it can later be pinned
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/dCVYGpEYppxQKrPYfupJcN
I believe its better because to me it sims better, you dont need ros neck to make it work, you dont take cloaks from classes you shouldnt be taking themt from and ofc its the best because 164 spellhit is :FAP:
have you simmed them dealing more raiddmg therefore lower killtime and better personal dps?
well this could make sense because I sim with 2 lusts and you sim with 1 lust. My setup has 20 more spellpower and slightly more crit but some haste less, so my setup should benefit more from the extra lust than yours does
why does my allstar ranking on wcl not update? I dont get it that log was uploaded like 26 hours ago
real team players spam rank 1 shadow bolt to apply isb
Is oblivion set worth it for seeding in full bis gear? I mean u lose 2p t4 and a bunch of stats
whats a decent price for blaze of wizardry?
if ur not 10/10 then its not the game being shit it is you
a fury warrior is straight up the same thing but better
shouldnt this be like pretty good for bombing waves in hyjal? should have a very high uptime since usually you (or melees at least) focus down single mobs before bombing
the thing is 3 gold I can just go and test about killing blow
Wait so... if me saccing is 50%... ok kinda shit but what if all warlocks sac, does it count for each other? Basically all warlocks will have a sac orgy before each pull?
this was literally this discord about fire wl tbf
depending on a mage is the ultimate dog move
depending on a mage for scorch is like when youre still living with your parents which are some degen alcoholic patriots that hate on anything that possesses a brain and beat up their pets but youre too young and insecure to move out, also you saw what happened to Tony who moved out of his degen parent's house and now he's selling blows behind the dumpster at Wendy's and you don't want to end up like Tony, that's essentially what relying on mages is
99% of players should have been told to go shadow start phase 1, yet again no coherence with what this discord is propagating
:pepetear2:  will need this with skull
if ur too lazy for pvp neck why r u even here
I played the first half of the phase in a shit tier guild that disbanded after failing to kill kt/vashj, and the second one in a better but still meh guild
I have literally never been in a raid that contained a warlock better than me, so I dont know what I should be doing better, also in the better guild theres no aff
on my pserver haste gems were available with hyjal/bt so Im not surprised
shouldnt take long, 4 hearts is nothing and you can take any crafter on the server
wanted to respond to the guy considering s3 bracers
u can have haste bracers very quickly
illidari council is simming better for me no matter what I try
can a mod put an internal cooldown on these copypastas please. thanks
can a mod put an internal cooldown on these copypastas please. thanks
can a mod put an internal cooldown on these copypastas please. thanks
I would rather flex skull at aldor bank in p3 than in p5 when many people will have it
playing fire means being an inferior player with extra steps :yikes:
on void reaver I ss myself as a way to reset aggro because our tanks are shit
being fire means relying on mages which is the ultimate dog move

My bank space is mostly used for shards so I can restock during raid w/o dps loss
if we were able to summon people from outside we would be asked way more often to summon people during raid so Im kinda happy about no qol there
wrong
the option to mana pot other casters have is to stop casting at all or to use inferior spells, with life tap we have basically infinite mana, indicating that mana pot should have less value for us, but actually it doesnt, so the statement quoted is correct, mana pot is more dps for us than destro pot although on first sight the opposite is indicated
only if its ISB stacking only
if they had balls larger than a grain of sand, they would just create those harder versions now
I tried retail in summer and despite being new to retail it took me LITERALLY 2 weeks from lvl 1 to carrying my own weight in +15 dungeons, the raid/dungoen content itself is not what made me quit shortly afterwards, but the 50 different treadmill systems installed to make you play the game
is it hyjal or bt?
Im not in the business of raid leading but Ive cleared bt like 200 times on pserver so I should be able to feed some information to whoever raidleads
you need someone to kick at council
even if channeled elements turned out to be a tiny bit better, any guild with half a brain shouldnt give it to you, because the boost for other classes is so much better
I didnt consider non vestments locks, though they would uninstall at the start of p3
they still shouldnt get them
any guild should still kill vashj
just dont be the pleb that has to apply coe/cor
this would allow us to bring max number of regs https://tbc.wowhead.com/raid-composition#0tHJvgsyyyysyyyysyyyyszyyy
!Hildi
why is it that every time i open this discord, it's always u bonobos talking about some degen shit
this should work better than the previous I posted https://tbc.wowhead.com/raid-composition#0sJJJqsyyyysyyyysyyyyszyyy
maybe swap grp 1 resto for resto druid to add motw and improve tank healing or something
you casted 437 shadow bolt and your guildie casted 474 shadow bolt and thats why he beat you
dealing damage to the adds only opens the potential of idiots dying, just ignore adds
the best way for you to improve your dps is by telling these melees to not die, youre never gonna parse decently in a 10:30 alar kill
also that priest lol
your raids needs to bring way more shamans, 2 shamans only is unplayable basically
relative to everyone else in your raid you did really well, if you want to do better youre probably just gonna end up being frustrated by everyone else holding you back
for the kill its just 3 more, he casted quite a bit more shadow bolt over the course of the whole raid though
obtaining nible thought is piss easy idk why anyone would waste thoughts on other bracers
just hit 5m fishing xp
wtf is this
your loss
the bot told me "You are not eligible for roles from that message."
if you have shit loot distribution and waste a lot of loot, that may result in a lot of pain for a mediocre guild
this command is just full of shit
generally one of the most delusional official takes on this discord, idk why you make it to be about ZD only if its a general statement Ryu you should know my stance on ZD anyway due to TOC+chronicles existing and resurgence of the need of spellhit rating in SWP existing, generally loot is a limited resource and after distributing you cant change it, if you distribute loot objectively inefficiently eg by giving a player a 10 dps upgrade instead of giving another player a 30 dps upgrade, that hurts the performance of the raid which indirectly affects the happiness of the players since most players at least on same level care about the performance of the raid, it can also directly impact the happiness of the players if they identify the error and find out that their loot council is making ill informed decisions, therefore statement C) is incorrect, way more than 1% of guilds want to at least do as well as they can in raids, clear new content as soon as they can and then clean it in timely fashion, that statement only applies to guilds that are still 8/10 clearly indicating that they dont really care and just arent good at the game, the rest of guilds (certainly >50%) should in general aim for at least somewhat efficient loot distribution, eg give  vestments to warlocks and channeled elements to others or eg not give council cloak to warlocks if all they gain from it is like 6-7 dps, while others gain 20+ and others have inferior options that are harder to obtain, just because a guild isnt exactly speedrunning doesnt mean that they shouldnt make informed decisions on loot, also preparing informed prios is a 1 time effort per phase while the proposed options are efforts that have to be done perpetually and probably they are done anyway, if loot distribution isnt only subjectively but also objectively sound, then the gain of raid strength can help mask bad play, also all of the above explains the ignorant take that is D) in that command
10 vs 20 dps is not a one time thing, it occurs many times in a raid, you can save hundreds of dps in a raid
I live in the badlands and the only store closes in 30 mins so ill disenchant your wisdom some time later
You implied that people dont care about raid performance by suggesting to not consider objective efficiency when distributing items or at least you performed a command that made the bot say so, allowing for attribution of the bot's statement to your own public stance. If you dont want that happening, then dont perform the command that makes the bot say that or change what the bot says. 

Efficient item distribution impacts the performance of the raid more than marginally. Single choices may not make much of a difference but these choices accumulate over the course of a phase and the addon, good and bad objective loot distribution can easily add up and end up making a quadruple digit dps number of difference, in your average dadguild that means playing with 1 more or less dps player, which is a difference significant enough to matter for such guild. 

Often mediocre raids have many bad players and if you are bad at world of warcraft at the end of 2021 its probably not gonna change. So actually, being able to impact the raid performance without having to expect anything from anyone other than the acceptance of loot council decisions is a very powerful tool and should not be disregarded in the way statement D) in the bot command that you performed does. You may think that raid dps is not that important for inferior guilds and that a few hundred dps squeezed out by more efficient item distribution isnt worth the effort, but actually raid dps is very important for inferior guilds. This is because raid dps allows you to kill bosses and enemies quicker which means all of your bad players have less time to sabotage the raid with their suboptimal gameplay, so not only EVEN but in fact ESPECIALLY mediocre guilds should pay attention to the objective efficiency of their item distribution.
@Ryusie As for ZD specifically, I never even said that ZD should be warlock/mage prio, my stance on ZD is the following: 

T6 raid content has 2 weapon options which are vastly superior to any other weapon options that existed before. Getting the glad weapon will not be an option for most players. It should be the goal of every guild that as many casters as possible own one of those 2 weapons. These weapons are ToC and ZD. Only warlocks, mages and prot paladin can even wear ToC. Assuming that haste gems exist which PTR suggests, the ToC+Chronicles option is only a 12 dps downgrade from ZD for a warlock as per the simulation I just performed. This is assuming perfect totem uptime which is something that only exists in simulations. In any raid, even in better raids, there will be at least some totem downtime, increasing the value of ToC+Chronicle, because with that option you have at least 182 spell hit rating, 200 if you choose to go with nethervoid cloak. 

Also the value of ToC+Chronicle will increase in P5 because there will generally be more haste, relativising the haste on ZD while ToC+Chronicle empowers the now available additional haste. Also hit rating may be a factor again in SWP, which ToC+Chronicle possesses, and ZD does not. Usually it won’t be an option to give both weapons to one single player. So what raids should do is give ToC/Chronicle to warlocks/mages and give ZD to the other classes. They make more use of ZD and their lollipop option isn’t as good as ToC is. Otherwise the situation is possible that ToC drops and there’s noone to make use of it. The loss that would be is significant enough to matter for any guild that intends to clear SWP, which likely is a goal of most raiding guilds.
@Ryusei Furthermore it's hypocritical or at least “”interesting”” that now you suggest that the average Joe shouldn't care too much about minor dps increases while also you suggest or at least suggested that people should play fire warlock, which is/was only a minor dps increase with major implications (raid setup, gold cost, extra effort for flexibility). That suggestion ended up being a bait for 99% of the player base. It was the biggest bait in all of TBC, maybe even in modern human history. With playing fire warlock many extra steps are involved resulting in little if any gain, but for 99% of guilds keeping players happy and rewarding their contribution to the team is more important than minmaxing raid dps. They would have been better served organising assignments, holding vod reviews and recruiting for filled places if they really want to boost raid performance. It's incoherent to now suggest that guilds should neglect mInOr dps efficiency by valuing subjective aspects of loot distribution more than objective ones when this concept of minmaxing in the high double to low tripe dps number is precisely what you proposed in phase 1.
quag use curve should look kinda like this
some chinese guild DESTROYED the ssc world record using SHADOW destro only
the shit tier guild I had joined after my actual guild disbanded had egpgp, and they allowed the fire mage to put vestments into his bis list, luckily this guild was too stupid to kill vashj and disbanded, now Im in a somewhat better guild and the first vestments went to me :pepe_happy:
you can attach a bunch of rulings to EPGP essentially turning it into half a loot council but more transparent and I think then its fine, but most guilds dont go through that effort and most guilds dont have the balls to actually reward good players with extra EP and punish by taking away EP, handling EPGP properly is so much effort that you might aswell just do a loot council at that point
why is it that every time i open this discord, it's always u bonobos talking about some degen shit
be careful with SS
Wheres the sign up?
generally one of the most delusional questions on this discord
haste bracers are so easy, what you do is organize a PUG hyjal trash farm at midnight at release, its so easy anyone can do that, but because youre doing all of that "work" you lock the first 4 hearts for yourself, then next day all you need is a crafter and you have the whole server available for that
RoS boots exist and take ele and boomkin out of the contention, fsw boots are about the same value still for spriest, so only arcane mages remain to contest
channeled elements is extremely contested
but not by us 🙃
literally all t6 chests are packed with stats except warlock, same for t5, thats why vestments are so valuable to us, because our tierpieces in that slot are garbo, it doesnt apply on the same level to other classes, thats why they prefer channeled elements
tell them to make it ZD mage>wl, skull wl>mage
why tho
I was the first vestments haver because I was the best player, so Im kind of expecting to be the first skull haver aswell, unless I turbo int t6 progress or something
they gave me first vestments although it was only my 4th or 5th raid with that guild, the other locks existed long before me, bis LC
!shadowdestro
m'uru, m'uru and m'uru?
felmyst adds kind of a joke and boss speed is time gated in that phase anyway
Im not even sure where these sims seeing fire ahead or even are coming from, its straight up worse when I sim it
I bet when people sim fire vs shadow they forget that shadow can run 5/5 cataclysm which is a 20 dps gain
well with how much he gets to seed not that surprising, hes far ahead in seeding and is probably also predotting before seeding https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/AJqcD7hdwHkZ4mrT#boss=-3&start=0&end=2332001&type=damage-done&ability=27285
what its true
Ive been running 5/5 cataclysm since crossroads
so most of the time you get 0 dps but sometimes you get loads of dps, how exactly does that make it worse?
only 5 were fire
they should cut all mages and all fire warl 🤡 cks and add a 2nd shadow priest for improved shadow weaving uptime
p3 will feature 90% average isb uptime, conservative yet educated estimate
just farm the first few waves of hyjal
the reason you get shadow res for mother is the teleport where you all get fucked, if you have other means of surviving that teleport, you dont really need shadow res at all
im unironically considering bringing swiftness potion for mother
it almost sounds like if there were multiple version of the same raid, that would make all types of players happy, they could call them normal, heroic and mythic or something
why does hildi sim not include bowiz weaving?
no but seriously how much of a gain is bowiz weaving on single target? Ive created all weak auras and macros necessary, also I thought that one GCD im weaving in would be a good opportunity to shop at the rep bot for the next power core
im looking at bowiz as an extension of my playstyle, not just some gimmick or something, people say that warlock is just spamming shadow bolt, but now im also bowiz weaving, you wouldnt be putting down bowiz weaving like that if it was an actual warlock mechanic, if it was, lets say it was a talent, everyone would do it and it would be normal no questions asked, its not fair to discriminate bowiz weaving just because it isnt an official warlock mechanic and requires some extra steps smh
does anyone know the average number of single target casts it takes for bowiz to proc?
when you have excess hit rating the pvp neck is bis, thats why when comparing ZD to ToC+chronicle, you also have to consider the dps gain from ToC+chronicle enabling pvp neck
then u cant wear pvp neck
purple gems should be stronger than green ones, and since neither are like super contested I think its fine to grab the purple ones
bowiz weaving is worth it on single target in a PW style fight
I did some napkin math and thoughts on bowiz. So even though Hildis isnt doing his job by adding bowiz weaving to the sim I can definitely say that bowiz weaving is worth it on single target in a PW style fight. There is a 68% chance that you can get both your bowiz to proc and to make full use of the proc before the first 20 seconds of the encounter, during which you are lusted. That's 7 casts which last 1.92 seconds + 4 casts that are affected by lust and proc (4x1.63), in total thats 19.96 seoncds. Why is 20 seconds important? Because thats when you still have your 144 spellpower from icon active and switching (GCD) while thats active is in most cases not worth it. Having bowiz active here is a 3564 damage gain, since your average shadow bolts are hitting for 5900 during that time as per sim and the 4 bowiz affected casts during lust let you cast an additional 0.6 shadow bolts which is equal to 3564 damage. The cost of opportunity - in my case - is not wearing bloodmaw mageblade for those 20 seconds. That costs me about 75 dps compared to the raw stats of bowiz (raw stats = if bowiz was just a stat stick that doesnt have a proc it would be about 75 dps worse than bloodmaw during lust). So the cost of opportunity of wearing bowiz compared to mageblade is about 1500 damage. If bowiz doesnt proc and I weave it out after 20 seconds by tapping (which at some point I have to do anyway in a PW style fight), I've lost 1500 damage. The chance of that happening is 32%. If it does proc I gain around 3500 damage, minus cost of opportunity that equals to a 2000 damage gain. So its a 2000 damage gain happening 68% of the time (1360 average gain) vs 1500 damage loss happening 32% of the time (480 average loss). It should also be worth it to just keep bowiz equipped if you are unlucky and it doesnt proc within 20 seconds, but this example makes it obvious that its in general worth doing.
there is another 1000 word essay existing but I thought this shorter one would do it to make the point
tapping during lust can be either good or bad
this is just with tapping, you can also have a massive brain and know that you will be able to get 2 dooms in and 1 coa, so what you do is you start with coa and then you weave in bloodmaw with the first doom cast
btw you could also use shadowburn to weave out bowiz and it would still be worth
is that with or without drums?
not considering 5/5 cataclysm (bis talents) either, smh
🤯
I tried to do this last raid and thought it was nice, at least with only having bloodmaw mageblade as my primary weapon, thought for example it was super nice on trash, for morogrim (weave in when tapping up for murlocs), for vashj when I was oom in p3 anyway and was able to weave in a nice little proc when it mattered most, sometimes I fucked up a little but thats a matter of getting used to it, I think at least with my other weapon option its very strong https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Pg7Lr2tzavTRpdQD#boss=-3&difficulty=0&type=damage-done (ignore the part where the raid doesnt kill KT and in general holds me back)
"taunt cd"
I think what will be just as common is people having issues with their bars and being unable to press any spells because their 7head weakaura only interface has the main bar disabled, so they cant control the ghost
if u cast immolate in 2022 honestly kinda uninstall
not really a reason to move during anetheron either, unless you get the thing, but most of the time you dont, like teron
ill use the time to perfect boweaving
swap after proc
u can weave it into anything it doesnt have to be life tap
it could be soul shatter, a curse, shadowburn
sometimes you dont even need to weave it, take kael weapon phase for example, you have the time to use that gcd beforehand
if ur not a boweaver ur not rly trying tbh, if boweaving was built into warlock via talents and it was included in Hildis sim to show you that its worth, youd all be doing it like zombies no questions asked
survivability
if haste gems are in it can have even more haste
I'm so glad blizzard decided to nerf Hydross along with SSC/TK instead of leaving it alone. Now it’s okay if I do not understand the coordination and complexity from the fight. I've always believed that blizzard would do the right thing. I am resubbing on both my accounts and uninstalling the old dead mmorpg Lost Ark. All my years on WoW have lead to this single moment...
taking channeled elements and high lord cowl because youre last for t6 and want to wear ZD in healer group is grief
channeled elements are bis for all casters not called warlock, so taking them as a temporary bandaid solution is a waste
the future of tidewalker killing is not killing tidewalker
thats why I said just play shadow from the start, and I was parsing 99s consistently anyway doing so, but regardless I was ridiculed by the cult 🤷
ye u lose weight
@Kristofer boweaving to websim when?
wrong, boweaving worth on bosses too
Bowiz has a 15% chance of proccing, that means in 55.6% of cases it will proc at or before the 5th cast, so if you then weave it out, you skip a massive portion of the 50 second ICD, making it VERY STRONG WEAPON. You can weave the swap into ANY gcd. Often that will be life tap but you can also for example start a 2 minute 40 bossfight with curse of agony and then weave your swap into doom, or you weave it into soul shatter, you could also weave it into shadowburn, anything really. And often bossfights will have mechanics making you move/tap or do any of these things anyway.
Why is the bot assuming life tap is the only gcd potentially occurring?
not pressing only the same button for once = high end of skill level :thonk:
the hardest part about boweaving is not forgetting to maintain oil on both weapons, the rest becomes easy and natural after half a raid of getting used to it, have you ever asked yourself how complex of a process tying your shoes actually is? its really damn hard, yet after learning it you do it everyday without thinking about it and its not even a question that tying your shoes is efficient for walking, thats basically what boweaving is
bringing ele at best 400 dps gain (for the group), while the ele deals like 1k less dps compared to a warlock
its better if you dont need the hit from ros neck
180 hit is the lowest you get with that, but people never account for the extra hit because they assume 10000000000% totem uptime, which is just not what reality looks like
163 sims better
if its the "ultimate bis" setup you have in mind
its not worth gemming hit in that situation
its also better than fetish from ZA even not considering hit and by the time you could be getting heart of the pit in sunwell, hit starts to matter again, just an overall great item to have an utilize
and because it implies you should have ToC, that one will set you up to pick up heart of the pit
why is it that every time i open this discord, it's always u bonobos talking about some degen shit

You know what would make me feel depressed? If I was a hardcore fire cultist and I came to the realisation that I'm losing ground not just in the grand scheme of things, but also in detail constantly. ISB uptime is improving weekly, daily, probably even as I'm writing this the average ISB uptime across all raids in the world of warcraft is improving as shadowchads are picking up more and more items with spellcrit rating. You are losing literally as you're reading this because someone in some raid out there just got fathstome. You are losing, losing and losing - constantly. You have been losing, you are losing and you will be losing until the very end of the expansion. Every breath you take, every incinerate you cast, every imp you sac you are LOSING. ISB uptime is increasing constantly just like the sun is expanding, ironically things will get too hot for you fire warlocks and you will go extinct just like the dinosaurs, except that noone will miss you. Personally? I couldn't handle it. But that's why I chose not to be a loser. I'm a winner. A shadow destro chad.
sometimes I play other games but eventually I just default back to wow and oldschool runescape

Cata is a 15 dps improve on average, what else would you use those skillpoints on, 5/5 denial?
so he doesnt even get coe
ToC users will be above ZD users in logs, ZD is just a tiny bit "better" but being a ToC user implies that raid members exist who you are fine handing ZD to, this indicates you have an overall good raid which helps with parsing a lot, also ToC users have a high iq and massive cock so their gameplay will outweigh the 10 dps difference in weapon stats
füll
slam it as soon as you have aggro room, skull making you cast faster means quag will proc sooner
haste scales with haste if the one haste allows the other haste to reach a breakpoint
eg 3 casts affected by quag vs 4
with haste gems in the healer haste cloak is not bis for warlock but yet people keep repeating that lie
what warlocks should do with cloak is take nethervoid and be happy with it and in the 2nd half of the phase see if they can get illidari council cloak
even then, I like being able to log into my character anytime I want to not having to worry about buffs ticking, fuck world buffs
they should have removed world buffs from the game from the start
people unironically playing SoM are so depressed they feel nostalgic for what was just 2 years ago

no, the bowstring makers are the ones making themselves sound like boweavers
cata scales with boweaving but yet again noone is considering that
pretty sure haste gems being in on ptr yet again is a strong indicator of haste gems actually being in, also people were questioning CSD and it ended up being in, so Im leaning towards gems being in rather than out
havent simmed this tho
haste allows us to consume ISB stacks before stupid ass SPs have a chance of stealing
not if we take ZD from them saying haste is valuable to us because of SPs stealing stacks
resto shamans should use haste gems
you are discussing the expected demand of gems by trying to guess what people should in theory use, while actually demand is made of by what people want to use, which isnt always what they should be using, haste is new and shiny while the other stats arent so expect there to be more people wanting to gem yellow haste than there should be in theory
you nerds would gain more dps by taking care of your mental and body eg by going for a walk an hour a day than by malding over 15 theoretical dps
it literally is
it is bro

if you use ToC/Chronicle they are literally equal and theres no point taking it from a healer other than greed, if you use ZD crit cloak is far ahead
you can settle with nethervoid until first people have gotten crit cloak
if you view your guilds loot system as a game and you know that due to limited amount of ids you cant get 100% bis for the phase but you can get 85% bis, if you have half a brain you stay away from very contested items that are single digit dps gain, you will end up "winning" the game by taking items like toc+chronicle, nethervoid, pvp haste neck while pushing for items that matter like skull, tier set and slippers
@Stabile this is with toc+chronicle (500k iterations each)
@Stabile these are the cloaks in toc+chronicle bis gear, ogre magi gains a lot from items like skull adding hit from nowhere or to phrase it differently, it voids the value ruby drape adds
nethervoid only looks kinda lame here because its simmed in full bis gear and you make no use of the spellhit rating, if you pick it up early, which isnt unlikely because it drops from trash and isnt super contested, it will have a lot of opportunity to add value until you get items like skull and toc/chronicle adding all that spellhit rating
just to stress the value of nethervoid early on, this is assuming phase 2 bis gear, if you run into either of these cloaks with just phase 2 bis gear these are the results, cloaks with no spellhit rating have to return to spellhit sockets elsewhere, suffering value
shroud is high up because its the first static haste added to the character, its way more impactful at that point than with p3 bis gear
someone got link for that?
can crix raid finally kill illidan so he has time to post the sign up and I can go to sleep?
wtf
I stayed awake for the sign up
and now this
If we cant have lockcord PTR raid can we please at least have a signup for lockcord lvl 1 warlock Hogger raid on an existing server?
SoM is probably being handled by the intern's dog
@Shaggydaggy make Hogger raid a thing Im not trusting this PTR shit anymore, we were promised a raid, no more excuses
So wheres the lvl 1 warlock Hogger raid sign up? We were promised a lockcord raid and a Hogger raid has advantages only 1) can take place on any server not just PTR that is down most of the time 2) everyone can participate not just 25 players 3) dont have to spend half an hour on laggy PTR to prepare a character, just go naked 4) it can take place before everyone pisses off to christmas and subsequently forgets about lockcord raid 5) probably more fun than buggy laggy sweaty PTR anyway
I would trade my cat for skull

Spriest personal dmg scaling is bad, spriest overall value scaling is pretty damn good
its more important for blizz to make their 15 year old game in line with LGHDTV+ than to touch anything actually related to gameplay, some intern out there is drawing male pixel ass and recording himself moaning while he could be fixing seed bug, taking care of dead servers or introducing quality of life updates
in general Im a fan of keeping politics the fuck out of games, its precisely what I dont need in games, if they want to make "gender tweaks" thats fine by me Im not whining about incubus @spoar but its just a slap in the face when this is what theyre spending actual resources on while theyre failing to do anything else and while everyone knows theyre only doing it because they think they will make more profit doing it or like somehow make bobby lose less court cases, not because they actually "mean" it

gl with 4 healers in swp
average dadguild may even require 6 because their healers are slow and people avoid less damage, but general meta should be 5
ZD becomes more irrelevant the faster you go
ToC users will be above ZD users in logs, ZD is just a tiny bit "better" but being a ToC user implies that raid members exist who you are fine handing ZD to, this indicates you have an overall good raid which helps with parsing a lot, also ToC users have a high iq and massive cock so their gameplay will outweigh the 10 dps difference in weapon stats
they are equal they may just not end up feeling equal because thats how rng works
if its 5 months from bt release to swp release so like 21 ids thats 3.675 skulls on average, honestly thats not many
bt splits not an option for most guilds
actually this is a repost, when I first posted it jpaint instantly deleted it, hes gonna have a good time waking up to what he thought he had deleted being on the starboard
why use res boots over rocket boots?
oh lmao

on first tele use swiftness potion, on second tele use engi boots, on third tele use swiftness potion again if available
thats how you achieve max ferrari uptime
we've established that skull should definitely be lock prio, we've also established that raids that dont run splits (which is the vast majority of raids (this is a fact BTW even if your sweaty basement bubble suggests otherwise)) on average will get 4 skulls and 4 ZDs until sunwell is released (then nobody will care about bt anymore), most raids run at least 3 wl 1 ele 1 boomer 1 sp 2 mage or some variant of that so 8 casters at least and you have in total 8 fatty fat items dropping from illidan (no the healer cloak does not count as a fatty fat item), this means by merely saying that warlock should be allowed to contend ZD early before it has dropped like 3 times youre also saying that that warlock absolutely can grab a quarter of the fatty fat items within the first few ids although he only makes an eighth of all casters, this is not how you keep your raiders happy (I hope you got the reference) and furthermore stacking these items on just one character implies major cluster risk, if that player says bye bye to your raid group youve lost 2 insane items (plus an insane player since you suggest ZD should be a "player thing" (whatever that means)) whereas if you distribute those items more evenly you have that risk more spread out, on top of that if you stack too many good items on just one player, you lose power over that player, hes always ready to jump ship since he got what he want and you can only hope that he will follow your commands since hes got what he wants, the prospect of cucking warlocks with ToC works a lot better from a guild member management perspective since you can still make them hope that they will get ZD, even if most likely they wont, but you dont have to tell them, as long as the other option is not some gigadad gamer, having other casters grab ZD first is not only better for raid dps but also for the hegemony within your guild, defaulting the item to the biggest """pUmpEr""" is malicious and will cause problems bigger than raid dps
ToC users will be above ZD users in logs, ZD is just a tiny bit "better" but being a ToC user implies that raid members exist who you are fine handing ZD to, this indicates you have an overall good raid which helps with parsing a lot, also ToC users have a high iq and massive cock so their gameplay will outweigh the 10 dps difference in weapon stats
same tbh
except mages
how much is black pearl on your servers?
:thonk:
it heavily depends on what youre actually simming, compared to other stats haste falls off as you get more and more of it because haste causes other stats to regain value, this means the first haste you acquire in p3 is the most valuable and then it gets worse and worse, this makes it so that shroud of the highborne is very impactful at the start when youre still mostly wearing p2 gear and starts losing to illidari council cloak towards the end of your p3 gearing process, also it makes a difference if youre simming with 1 lust or 2 lusts, personally Im getting a 2nd lust most of the time so I sim with 2 but that wont be the situation for everyone, the neck choice is similar to the cloak one, in phase 2 bis gear the pvp neck with an orange epic gem (spell/spellhaste) beats sun king's talisman by more than 7 dps so anyone should definitely get it and at the end of the phase its still equal with the ros neck (ignoring the need of spellhit rating)

(the p3 bis sim is with toc/chronicle, this means when using ZD, shroud of the highborne will fall off even more)
so if you pick up ZD maybe that means you need to compensate for your tiny peepee but its still technically "ok", but if youre picking up ZD AND the shroud its actually just a gigapepega move and you should feel bad beyond your peepee
well as you can see its not
using 1 lust or 2?
thats literally what I just said you incapable cunt
it varies based on which conditions you assume
you unironically think shroud is gonna allow you to reach a breakpoint on casting seed at hyjal trash or whatever?
the haste on shroud isnt gonna do shit for seeding in most situations, while the crit on illidari cloak works everytime
shroud wins by 2 dps with 1 lust when using toc/chronicle, illidari cloak wins by 1.5 dps when using ZD with 1 lust
p3 bis
orange gems I should add
nvm its red gems
so a better situation for shroud doesnt exist and it still loses
illidari will be even better when you gem orange
if you have trouble understanding how useless a small amount of haste is for seeding, think of solarian. in most guilds you will be able to cast 2 seeds on the spawning adds and thats it, after that you can go and cast hellfire or something, not even a 100 extra haste is gonna allow you to cast 3 seeds so that haste ends up being useless, meanwhile all other stats are being applied to the 2 seeds you do get to cast
I'll get s3 bracers too, survivability item with res socket for mother

"read this guy's guide on wowhead might aswell use his sim"
*quits after entering 3 values*
1) you still wear skull in sunwell and you heavily rely on the spellhit rating skull provides in sunwell 
2) ZD/ToC is "only" a 50/40 dps upgrade from something like maelstrom+fathomstone
3) arena weapons exist
4) ZA adds another at least decent weapon
5) skull is a 50 dps upgrade when you can make full use of the spellhit it provides (no skull means youre stuck with BoB)
6) is still a 30 dps upgrade when not making use of the spellhit
skull has a cool ass fel effect
its a mage
sunfire robe basically doesnt exist, if it drops you should do everything to get it but be prepared for never seeing it, the tier parts are really whatever because 3 of them drop each boss so everyone will get them super fast
never realized my draenei mage on pserver is like the perfect lockcord trigger
the server has been online for over a decade
and was stuck in phase 3/4 for like 6 years
on this server paladins with skull and toc exist
ryusei kinda smells
its only worse than ros if youre a ZD yoinker, if you got toc route pvp neck is superior
taking ZD is pathetic tho
when the warlock takes ZD
everything I say is reflected by my ingame actions which are public via logs, so how am I a troll?
pvp haste neck doesnt require an epic gem to be better than sun king's talisman, its more than 2 dps better than sun king's using a runed living ruby
(in otherwise p2 gear)
im talking about using it with p2 gear
so about the question should I instantly just get it after p3 is live
only matters for seeding when the additional haste actually translates into throughput which typically it doesnt when seeding because the nature of seeding is that mobs die rather quickly
🤡
their type was like giga irrelevant they would have had the same time running shadow, probably better time even
the t6 itself has it and just about everything else has nothing
we have 164 spellhit in sunwell bis, which includes skull, so if you dont have skull by sunwell you can go and delete your character
make it 3 resto sham 1 resto druid
rest is fine make sure preist is coh and not some meme shit
no but its just anticlimatic and a waste of raid slot
for what druid is actually doing 1 is fine and all but 2 is weird
if the social implications make such an adoption too hard I guess its fine to keep it like that if you dont care that much
just not very optimal but its not like impossible to clear these raids with that healer setup
thats why I didnt want to go to hard on the 2 druid thing, in reality, I want to literally vomit if I imagine 2 rdruids in the same raid, but this is probably a hardcore dadguild and unless they ACTUALLY REALLY TOTALLY want to improve, who gives a fuck anyway, probably not worth starting a hunt on their druid if nothing matters anyway
the professional term for it is "boweaving"
I wasnt the best in geology or whatever but its also the furthest away from the raid
@Itsmarco
The type of aoe damage arcane mage provides is completely irrelevant for sunwell and fights generally last longer with less or almost none "chill for a sec" moments, fire is bis on the hardest encounter which is m'uru and also generally makes more of the items introduced, I will not be very surprised if fire mage makes a strong comeback in sunwell
boomer is not about age but about mentality and state of mind
normally I would wholeheartedly agree, your statement does contain a critical error though - its monday and therefore your wishes for a good weekend are misplaced
I have simmed shitposting and it comes out on top of just being a boring cunt, if noone was shitposting most people would lose interest in the channel and there would be less people around to brainstorm non shitposting matters. Shitposting is efficient and healthy.
I just simmed "yoinker zugzug bis" (ZD, 2 haste rings, illidari council cloak, RoS neck) vs the "noble and reasonable bis" (ToC, 1 haste ring, nethervoid cloak, pvp neck/sunkings talisman (those necks are essentially equal)) and the former only performed by 35 dps better than the latter even though the former contains 3 very contested items. You can only truly make full use of the yoinker zugzug bis if you have skull, otherwise you need to find compromises to gain the spellhit rating necessary, devaluing the items you yoinked until you got skull. Without skull the yoinker zugzug bis only achieves 138 spellhit rating, meaning you'd have to wear things like BoB or nethervoid cloak. Just a side note: Gemming hit has been and will always be an error as long as very efficient items such as nethervoid cloak (for p2 ruby drape) or BoB exist. These are the better trade. Now assuming you have all the items of the yoinker zugzug bis set except skull (forcing you onto BoB), picking up skull would be nearly a 50 dps upgrade. Since you've yoinked all these items, you will have moved away from being able to take skull within your guilds loot system assuming that things are distributed somewhat equally and assuming average drop rates. Therefore it makes zero sense to pick up the mentioned yoinker items as long as you dont have skull. You dont make full use of ZD and illidari cloak as long as you dont have skull while a second haste ring and ros neck make little difference. The noble and reasonable bis takes the path of least resistance leading up to skull. After getting skull you should make sure you have tier set, slippers and anetheron's noose covered. Only then you are allowed to yoink the mentioned yoinker zugzug items. It's not only about other classes making more use of those items or having a balanced overall distribution, but also about more effective personal character progression. If you achieve the noble and reasonable bis youve completed p3. Anything else is a bonus.
Can you please not copy paste my messages whenever I'm trying to make a point? It gets very tiring after some time and it's not my fault that my very gifted mind requires more than just a few words to explain matters of high complexity. You should be grateful that I'm even here to enlighten you and I demand to be taken seriously.
And BTW I want to make the following clear: Nethervoid cloak is not a bad cloak, it has high intrinsic value and it should not be dismissed as just some bad cloak. If you step into P3 with P2 equipment and you run into either of the 3 new cloaks available, nethervoid is the highest simming cloak at that point in your gearing progression. This is because the other cloaks - at that point - force you to find spellhit gearing compromises elsewhere. It's actual griefing to pick up illidari council cloak early in P3 as a warlock, not only because nethervoid initially is the stronger option for you anyway, but also because other casters don't even have this option. You will be stuck with nethervoid for the majority of the phase 3 and you will like it.

youre hitcapped because of ruby drape which is literally the exact same cloak as nethervoid except 23 less spellpower
thats only because you can find other comprimises, but those are worse, ruby drape is the most efficient spellhit rating compromise and its just the same for nethervoid
ruby drape doesnt even matter, youre honestly making yourself kinda look like a 🤡  show me the sim in which nethervoid isnt the highest dps out of all 3 P3 cloaks when otherwise wearing P2 gear, then start talking again
nethervoid at first is the strongest, then it starts falling off as you pick up P3 items

I guess this was meant as a joke because sapph cloak doesnt even get close to ruby drape
thats nice and all but at this point except extremely unlucky people will have drape and drape is part of phase 2 bis because its the most efficient item and it changes nothing about the P3 cloak conversation anyway. I'm still eager to see the configuration in which 
1) nethervoid is not the best simming cloak with otherwise phase 2 gear 
2) the general statement that nethervoid starts off extremely strong and only falls off as items like SKULL are acquired is proven incorrect
sorry, I interpreted you replying with "no" as a contest of what I was saying, misunderstandings happen I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
sure you pick up some hit, but you also drop some hit: no hit on antheron's noose, no hit on slippers, less hit on t6 legs - hit on t6 shoulders and t6 hands? yes cool and all but you want to be wearing 2p t4 until you actually get the t6 setbonus
only strengthening my point by claiming these items arent contestet, that implies you can pick them up early which is going to be most effective at that point if you have nethervoid. picking up illidari early is a 🤡  move
@Ryusei since you appeared to be disputing my thoughts on the nethervoid cloak by replying with "no", would you kindly **explicitly** agree to the following statements:
1) nethervoid cloak is the best simming P3 cloak when otherwise wearing P2 gear
2) generally warlocks should pick up nethervoid cloak early to supplement their P3 gearing process, leaving the illidari council cloak to classes that make effective use of it immediately and look to pick it up later when when they've picked up enough P3 gear to make effective use of it aswell
prove otherwise, I provided my results and my configuration you provide nothing
provide configuration
your configuration at first sight has 153 spellhit rating, did you even adjust that for each cloak option?
your configuration aims for vestments set bonus for no reason, pure waste
well Im not dealing with alliance setup, my statements apply to horde setup
@Krusty nope, you just dont know how to actually correctly gem and make full use of spellhit rating on items, I took your exact configuration, only changed the cloak slot and gems and achieved 2460.77 dps for nethervoid, while in your screenshot shroud was on top with 2454 dps
you did not, in your screenshot nethervoid has 2442 dps but using your configuration without faulty gemming it achieves 2461 dps
Is any of you clowns actually going to be able to prove the statement "nethervoid cloak is the best simming P3 cloak when otherwise wearing P2 gear" wrong? Or just here to talk trash?
Is any of you clowns actually going to be able to prove the statement "nethervoid cloak is the best simming P3 cloak when otherwise wearing P2 gear" wrong? Or just here to talk trash?
Still havent received a configuration proving the statement "nethervoid cloak is the best simming P3 cloak when otherwise wearing P2 gear" wrong. The only configruation shared only ended up strengthening my point.
you shouldnt misidentify your rambling as a "configuration"
stop wasting my time and energy and share a configuration proving my statement as wrong
and by the way - not that it even matters for my statement - ruby drape is p2 bis
red gems
nope, actually I proved it right and @Ryusei even admitted that I was right
ruby drape doesnt even matter
provide a config you fucking clown
I still see no config shared proving the statement "nethervoid cloak is the best simming P3 cloak when otherwise wearing P2 gear" wrong
I only see pointless rambling
I never even said which items to use, all I said was P2 items, you can use any items you want and put it in your configuration
stop clowning and provide a config
Cool story bro, are you now actually going to provide a config proving the statement"nethervoid cloak is the best simming P3 cloak when otherwise wearing P2 gear" wrong? Or just here to talk trash?
he disputed my claim by saying "no" and now hes refusing to give an actually credible stance on it
nethervoid starts off extremely strong and falls off during the gearing process, not even by too much, thats not a strawman and its not irrelevant, its in fact very relevant
All I asked for was a configuration and the only one I got wasnt even trying in terms of gemming. But at least they gave a configuration. Everyone else is just throwing things out there that may sound good to someone observing on a superficial level, but not actually proving anything. So how exactly do you expect me to remain in neutral composure?
I provide a view on an item slot based on logic and facts plus I provide sim results including the configuration proving my view and all you do is reply with "no" without adding valid arguments? Who exactly is making a fool of himself?
@Ryusei reread my initial message on the matter https://discord.com/channels/253210018697052162/823471727081422849/922544419960422431 Was it actually that aggressive, flustered or anything? Maybe it was portrayed in a bit of a bold way but can you dispute the essence? Not really. Is it irrelevant like you claimed? Also no, its about how that whole item slot should be treated in P3. And all I was given as a reaction was unfounded claims and mockery.
you replied with "no" and provided nothing further, if you didnt want to take a stance you would have said nothing, you werent willing to correct your stance either, you initially tried with sapph cloak and ended up having to make it look like a joke and now youre trying to make it seem like you never had a stance to begin with
Making claims and not backing them up with providing config is the actual insult at hand. People pile on me for nothing. Nethervoid cloak is the best simming cloak when otherwise wearing P2 bis gear. Nethervoid cloak is only simming 9 dps worse than illidari council cloak in P3 bis gear. It starts off strong and doesn't fall off too much. That is not some random sidefact that I'm insisting on, it's crucial information for a whole item slot.
share config
Your config contained wrong gemming, youre probably running around Orgrimmar with said wrong gemming, I provided information for better gemming, not only giving you a personal service but also proving my point - and this is how Im arguing in "bad faith"?
yes, its wrong as alliance also, I switched it around to be correctly gemmed and that improved dps significantly
I never disputed that you overcap in P3 bis gear. You dont in P2 bis gear and thats why it ends up being the best simming cloak when otherwise wearing P2 gear. And even though it overcaps in P3 bis gear, it only falls off to a point where its 9 dps worse than illidari council cloak. Im not suggesting to not pick up illidari council cloak, Im just saying nethervoid should be used at first and illidari council at a later stage.
@Krusty I took your config, changed the cloak to ruby drape and it now sims 3 dps better
obviously I adjusted the gemming doing so
and @Krusty  you havent shared how nethervoid sims worse. If you take what I just gave you and use nethervoid with that, nethervoid is at 2461 dps. taking what you shared, even after correcting your gemming and trying to make the best case possible for illidari council cloak, it only sims at 2448 dps. using alliance hit rating. So please explain to me how exactly I am wrong?
Well of course I'm still going. Nobody is able to prove my point wrong. Nobody is making a successful case that my point is irrelevant either. Nethervoid cloak sims for about 13 to 14 dps better than Illidari Council Cloak when otherwise wearing phase 2 gear, which will be the case when you first start your joruney into P3. 13 to 14 dps is honestly very significant. I tried to make the best cases possible for both cloaks when setting up the configurations. Nobody was able to provide a configuration that would successfully dispute this claim. What happens during the P3 gearing process is that you pick up items with additional spellhit, rendering the spellhit on nethervoid cloak useless and devaluing it relative to the other cloaks available. At the end of that process nethervoid cloak is 9 dps worse than Illidari Council Cloak, which is also significant, but not as significant. When you start out that gearing process, you still have spellhit gems in your gear, so even when you do pick up some of these more efficient items, you can still drop hit by getting rid of your old spellhit gems, so youre not immediately overcapped. At the same time you will drop a high amount of spellhit rating by picking up Anetheron's Noose and Slippers. So it's not some short term thing that will be irrelevant by your second or third raid or something. @Ryusei claimed that I was making a "dramatic statement" when saying only items like skull would change the spellhit situation significantly. And he was wrong about that. If you dont have skull but have otherwise P3 bis gear, you cant even wear Anetheron's Noose because you're forced onto BoB to meet spellhit requirements. You will be wearing nethervoid cloak for at least half of your gearing process and it will be effective to do so. Now adding the context that other caster classes that want illidari council cloak dont have this option, picking up illidari council cloak early is an extremely questionable move.
Can you please not copy paste my messages whenever I'm trying to make a point? It gets very tiring after some time and it's not my fault that my very gifted mind requires more than just a few words to explain matters of high complexity. You should be grateful that I'm even here to enlighten you and I demand to be taken seriously.
figuring out a bis list is trivial, if you want to provide actual value to raidgroups overall you try to consider context and aim for the most efficient compromises
I mean you can iceblock the mana drain debuff and if you werent tricked into arcfire, you can do so twice using cold snap, so its actually not as bad as it first seems to be
Every 45 seconds, if you have amazing raid dps, you will only get 2 of them (kill time sub 2:15), I would assume that for progress, most guilds will get 3-4, but it gets faster and faster
yes
if you have legit giga dogshit dps, the mark can cause serious trouble, because it gets applied faster and faster (45 sec, 40 sec, 35 sec, 30 sec...) but if you have good dps and you only eat 2 its a barely relevant mechanic, so its kinda like the more you are fucked the more you are fucked and the less you are fucked the less you are fucked
id guess about 5 dps in dps increase at best, if youre gonna be gemming red too, otherwise its just about 163 vs 164 spellhit
was thinking of warlock
phase wasnt horribly long, just sucks that they went for the boomer nerf, phase 1 was too long and phase 3 is gonna be around forever, only the sick items introduced in p3 can maybe salvage it
I dont trust people who sat through the world buff fiesta for longer than BWL
because all of that was a farce
the raids werent designed with worldbuff stacking in mind
and the concept itself just toxic
you can die without that being your fault and then all of the stacking effort wasted
well you werent able to compete at all without it
world buffs is objectively dogshit game design and anyone who actually enjoyed that shit seems dodgy to me
the best time I ever had playing WoW was 1.5 years ago when hardtuned SWP came out on pserver and we took over a month to clear it even though we raided daily for the first two weeks up to 4 am, it was an absolute sweatfest and being pushed to the limit was more enjoyable than anything else, so the potential would have been there but it appears blizzard doesnt give too many fucks, did notice they are working on hc/nhc swp tho
Are you asking me to share my sim showing that nethervoid is the best simming cloak out of the p3 cloaks available when otherwise wearing p2 bis or are you asking if anyone was able to provide sim settings proving that nethervoid is not the best simming cloak out of the p3 cloaks available when otherwise wearing p2 bis?
this one is for nethervoid
this one for illidari council
I was looking for the best gear configurations for both options and I thought using crimson fury was the most efficient way to meet spellhit rating when using illidari council
but the thing is doing that gets really bad really fast due to the hyjal ring upgrades
and you know overall to me its not about that speicific situation, just the overall diagnosis that for good reasons we will and should be rocking nethervoid for longer than some appear to think we will
well as per the simulations I have performed, in the case you can make full use of the spellhit rating on nethervoid - which you happen to be making in phase 2 gear - nethervoid is ahead not just marginally, but significantly, Im talkin 10 dps and beyond
https://discord.com/channels/253210018697052162/823471727081422849/922167334175645737
it was about a potential zhardoom yoinker arguing that zhardoom is like 10000 dps better for seeding, but usually you dont seed long enough for that to matter, meanwhile toc+chornicle has more crit and will work better for mixed situations (eg single target necros -> seed -> single target last remaining mobs)
cast lands sooner = first to pull aggro
well here's the deal you little shit, you are a) throwing out bait so cheap not even my goldfish would take it b) missing the part where in the meme the ToC toc enjoyer doesnt understand haste breakpoints either, so in theory I never claimed to do so in the first place and lastly d) not realizing I have run hyjal 50 times, no make that a 200 times and p3 seeding is all about hyjal, hyjal bombing works the following: the "winner" of the wave is determined within the first 10-15 seconds of the wave, after that mobs start dying or some retard pulled abonimation aggro and you have to run away, you're not reaching a breakpoint in that timeframe, you just want to cram as much juicy as possible into those 10-15 seconds, you do that with quags and by boweaving, not with some teeny tiny ZD haste
your first seed isnt determined by haste but by the timing you choose, if you just stand there spam tabbing seed when the wave arrives youre gonna have a bad time even if athene is the palatank
uhm no, you know your cast time and the one with slower cast time can simply start casting earlier, if you start casting as the wave gets in range youre gonna pull aggro
yeah but haste that matters matters, haste so small that it doesnt matter doesnt matter
my comment was not based on any facts or data. Just get the vibe that you are giga fried whenever you speak
Ever tried getting out a third seed at solarian adds with 50 haste? Lmao. Pathetic.
Holy shit this is still going 🤸
These guides suck, I'll just make my own guides with shadowbolts and boweaving
Use hildi sim if ur not
Which sim is it?
Also with haste you run and ride faster
Not just that it actually speeds everything up, ever since I got quags I have to shave beard every third day before it was fine every fourth.
Join a boomer guild and everything will take forever even if you're in max haste gear
Just apply your values with ZD to the following its easy and accurate
I did some napkin math and thoughts on bowiz. So even though Hildis isnt doing his job by adding bowiz weaving to the sim I can definitely say that bowiz weaving is worth it on single target in a PW style fight. There is a 68% chance that you can get both your bowiz to proc and to make full use of the proc before the first 20 seconds of the encounter, during which you are lusted. That's 7 casts which last 1.92 seconds + 4 casts that are affected by lust and proc (4x1.63), in total thats 19.96 seoncds. Why is 20 seconds important? Because thats when you still have your 144 spellpower from icon active and switching (GCD) while thats active is in most cases not worth it. Having bowiz active here is a 3564 damage gain, since your average shadow bolts are hitting for 5900 during that time as per sim and the 4 bowiz affected casts during lust let you cast an additional 0.6 shadow bolts which is equal to 3564 damage. The cost of opportunity - in my case - is not wearing bloodmaw mageblade for those 20 seconds. That costs me about 75 dps compared to the raw stats of bowiz (raw stats = if bowiz was just a stat stick that doesnt have a proc it would be about 75 dps worse than bloodmaw during lust). So the cost of opportunity of wearing bowiz compared to mageblade is about 1500 damage. If bowiz doesnt proc and I weave it out after 20 seconds by tapping (which at some point I have to do anyway in a PW style fight), I've lost 1500 damage. The chance of that happening is 32%. If it does proc I gain around 3500 damage, minus cost of opportunity that equals to a 2000 damage gain. So its a 2000 damage gain happening 68% of the time (1360 average gain) vs 1500 damage loss happening 32% of the time (480 average loss). It should also be worth it to just keep bowiz equipped if you are unlucky and it doesnt proc within 20 seconds, but this example makes it obvious that its in general worth doing.
Peepee Workshop
Im on my 
Phone tho
Paragraphs count as character so if I use those I tend to be above the character limit which means I cant send what Ive written
The approach was to find out boweaving average dps gain and to compare it to the cost of opportunity which is holding an otherwise inferior weapon
If there was a sign next to everyone's house updating the market value of the house each and every second, most people that otherwise have no problem investing six figure numbers on leverage in houses would be too scared to do it.
Im not suggesting its not worth buying a house, Im just saying people are ignorant about the actual risks involved. Like theyll think buying a house on leverage is safer than putting that money into a broad market index fund.
Its a gift that the risks of house buying arent as clear. That way many people came to wealth because they committed to something risky (risk=return) long term, rarher than fucking around.
House buying isnt a magical boost to risk adjusted returns, its the nature of the concept that makes it so popular. If you have the same risk adjusted returns in equities it can seem a lot riskier even if actually its not.
You can get extremely low % interest rates for buying stocks on margin aswell. But its a lot easier to margin call those stocks than it is to take away a house.
I do think house buying is an amazing concept for the average person to grow wealth, at least if its the one you live in.
I cant even comorehend this in depth real estate investing conversation started off with a question about boweaving
Just life tap + wep switch but works with any instant cast like curses or soul shatter also
depends on how delusional youre willing to be
it literally makes no difference, cataclysm or not is not why youre doing shit in raids, hes just trying to push his agenda
fire is straight up raid dps loss here and now in your average more or less balanced setup, you gain what, 50 simmed st dps per fire warlock, so if youre running 3 destros, which is what most people do, thats 150 dps gain, meanwhile your shadowpriest loses 200 and your mage hates you and you have to juggle gear and sac for it to even be viable, most people would be better off improving on their approach to specific (trash) encounters eg by boweaving, people that come here and ask about fire vs shadow are definitely not in the position to actually make fire be at least a neutral play within their raid roster
this is what Im planning to use for mother, its not finished yet but the general idea is to not have to use shitty overpriced green items and not have to use a heart of darkness https://seventyupgrades.com/set/qDSevNzaBkHfAXuKekr2Zk
try to get t5 items for offspec if you can because the whole thing is about surviving and tier items have a lot of stamina which helps with surviving, in general void spheres are pretty efficient in terms of dps loss per shadow resistance point, dont forget that theres a nice armor enchant for those pieces aswell, Im going for a similar approach, this is what my set looks so far https://seventyupgrades.com/set/asA4ZhSWtf1XXskCSbbMkH
yeah rather than going cowl, either t5 for offspec or dust off t4 helm if you have or arent wearing already
idk if boar speeds allows you to reach the movement speed breakpoint of breaking the chain earlier
my plan is to use swiftness potion on first port, rocket boots on second and again swiftness potion on third if the cooldown is available again (very unlikely I get 3 ports in 2 min tho), so I figured Ill be fine movement speed wise either way and would rather have a bit more res
I will work on a powerpoint presentation about p3 gearing showing the actual truths
if you had had any interest in actual adding to the discussion and providing information you would have said ok 1) is correct but 2) is incorrect for the following reasons but you started out by questioning 1), then realizing that youre losing and that actually Im correct even though at first you thought it wasnt possible, shattered by these ego crushing happenings you chickened out into 🤡  mode instead of just admitting that 1) is correct, digressing into ad hominem about me 1v9ing the channel (like a boss) and pretending like all that ever happened was me having a maldelirium , jfc I cant wait to see you stuck on nethervoid 13 weeks into p3, Ill keep playing, create a char on your server and travel to shatt just to see you stuck on nethervoid
healing is not about healing people but about saving them from literally dying which typically happens by healing them faster not healing them harder, all that matters is that people are topped off and cant be oneshot by the next best boss ability combo, whether you heal them to 90% or 100% is irrelevant, thats why the healing haste cloak should be given to healers because it makes an actual difference unlike all other cloak options they have had up until that point, I would know this because I mained a healer in classic and parsed a 100 on mandokir
I did parse a 100 on mandokir (logs expired unfortunately) Im a main healer that is just taking a break from healing, this warlock thing is just a small side gig for me
Im not going to pretend like I parsed 100 on mandokir because of skill, it was thanks to my dogshit guild taking all of the damages possible
well the point about healing faster being more valuable than healing harder stands
I think completing 4p t6 is up there, because after that you will hit above 10k not just every now and then, but pretty much everytime
the hardest part about boweaving is not forgetting to maintain oil on both weapons, the rest becomes easy and natural after half a raid of getting used to it, have you ever asked yourself how complex of a process tying your shoes actually is? its really damn hard, yet after learning it you do it everyday without thinking about it and its not even a question that tying your shoes is efficient for walking, thats basically what boweaving is

"Boweaving" is the terminus technicus for weaving Blade of Wizardry ("bowiz") in and out of your character's weapon slot during an encounter. Normally weapon swaps cause a global cooldown to occur, typically resulting in a loss of dps uptime if the weapon is swapped during combat. Thus it typically is inefficient to swap your weapon while you're intending to cast spells. This is not the case if the weapon swap is combined with the global cooldown of a spell eg life tap, shadowburn or soul shatter. Both actions can be performed at the same time. If you swap your weapon together with a spell that you would have used anyway, no loss of uptime can be attributed to the weapon swap. This means that you can start out fights wielding bowiz, wait for the proc to happen and then weave it out for a weapon with stronger stats, as a result - most of the time - skipping the majority of the 50 second inner cooldown that bowiz has. A successful performance of said actions is called a "boweave" and causes bowiz to be a much stronger weapon than it normally would be. After bowiz has come off the inner cooldown, another boweave can be performed for another proc. Jpaint kind of smells. The proc rate of bowiz is 15%, meaning that bowiz will proc at or before the 5th cast in more than 56% of cases. This causes boweaving to be a dps gain even in single target encounters. Here's an example. Warlock A: "How is warlock C dealing so much damage? I just can't keep up with him and I'm the one dooming!" Warlock B: "He's probably boweaving again..." Warlock A: "That must be it, I forgot that he's a master *boweaver*."
nexus key is fine but how about bathroom key?
you need to go full red or full orange in vestments, taking socket bonus in vestments is inefficient, and green gems are aswell
Does anyone know the iq breakpoint for understanding haste breakpoints?
if you sim p3 bis gear with custom isb ticked off you get almost 90% uptime

when you get to this w/o custom isb uptime idk how its even a question that 85% is realistic, yes the priest will steal some but not that much

Lucifron
In the beginning Lucifron was the largest german server by far, then alliance started losing real hard and transferred off the server since then the horde part is just slowly bleeding to death
I noticed another guild having a vote about transferring because the server is dying and the result was 20 yes 5 no or something
so maybe there will be a snowball effect soon
if the server dies and they dont offer free transfer im probably quitting
im not paying 25 euros or whatever just to transfer my 1k black pearl collection

they are required for some low level enchanting rod until end of cata or something
I bought them for 10-20 silver each, theyre already 5g each now on my server idk about other servers
the thing is, I wasnt even around then, I played classic on mirage raceway (alliance pve) which is a fine server still and my pserver guild wanted to start TBC on lucifron because the guy who started the whole thing thought it would make the pvp players happy because "pvp server" while also making the pve players happy because no actual pvp is happening on said pvp server, so I had to rebuild my whole economy and level from 1 to 60 just to be stuck on this meme-server and the guild disbanded halfway through p1 anyway because being on top of the server despite no classic items and no gold wasnt enough for some, so some guy hitlered the guild leadership, kicked everyone parsing below 99 and left 2 weeks later because he had a "one in a lifetime chance" to join salad bakers, we didnt have enough people left to keep raiding and noone wanted to try to salvage this wreck so we disbanded. btw he did end up playing with salad bakers for 3 weeks and then he left to go play retail, youd think you cant make this shit up and no I cant because its real
we got a vacuum cleaning robot for christmas
this shits a blessing

imagine your guild doesnt do vashj in p3 and they tell you illidan head is only a minor downgrade
so you dont even get wings
many dadguilds exist that still wont have that time
arent hydross shoulders bis for enhancer or something
xelrog went on a yuge ramble about nethervoid not being the best simming p3 cloak when otherwise wearing p2 gear, never actually providing a configuration proving so, actual clown
human in endgame kinda cringe but the leveling experience is legit
well everyone except those with an actual brain

its good, it doesnt contain boweaving so it could be better but the others also dont
I like freeing up glove slot from t4 because I got flowing thoughts so thats 2 socket slots for resistance and much needed hit rating when wearing res gear
"boweaving" is the more efficient term to use because its just one word, speak out loud "bowiz smuggling" irl and notice what a struggle it is to even say those words, I could not say those words reliably, then say "boweaving" and notice how smooth it is, like you dont even need to move your tongue or anything to say "boweaving", its just so natural, you could be sucking a dick and youd probably still be able to say "boweaving" because of how easy it is, try it, its clearly the more efficient word to use, Ive simmed it and its not even close, language changes all the time, get with the times or go with the times boomer
spriest does scale but its more the utility aspect that scales, because more and more haste entering the game means the mana pump spriest provides gains importance
legs are better than head but legs are giga contested and you can still go and kill just vashj in p3 and grab vestments so its kinda griefing to pick up legs
if you have fang then youre last in line for a p3 weapon, not having fang is the optimal play
well p3 is gonna last way longer and has 2 weapons I think everyone will get a p3 weapon unless very unlucky
literally 0 fangs in my guild so far
and 0 nexus key
then p3 weapons wont drop because all luck has been used up
well boss 1-4 in hyjal dont go beyond that, najentus, supremus, akama and mother certainly neither
also you have to consider what fight length even means
when youre talking about haste
ros for example may be a 5 minute fight but in reality its more like 3 short fights
gurtogg you have to move all of the time for picking up and dropping stacks, are you really reaching any breakpoint there just because of ZD haste? with ToC you may be casting just the same amount of shadowbolts there
and if that happens ToC is ahead bigly
if it doesnt end up making you cast more spells it didnt work
whenever you have downtime to the point where you cant even translate your haste into faster taps, eg ros phase transitions, the fight essentially stops, happens at illidan for example at least 5 to 6 times
I just gave jpaint a star thats how escalated things are
most of them are shorter than you think just like your penis
those are not the same thing though, theres no viable alternative to cataclysm, its literally just a bonus, meanwhile haste has to compete with other stats
NO
I didnt say it procs on 5 casts on average
I only said in 55.6% of cases it procs at or before the 5th cast
thats something different
on AVERAGE bowiz takes infinite seconds to proc
15%
its infinite because in theory it can also just never proc
ok whats the average of infinite?
this doesnt even happen in reality, when the mob is that close to dying both players with or without haste will finish it off with shadowburn because its not efficient to take on a 50/50 about the question whether the shadowbolt will even land
only someone actually doing ban worthy things would even consider a ban when disconnected randomly
if you stack 100 chicken shits cutting the encounter time to 20 seconds that helps everyone included even if its just a side effect, you may call it "collateral gain"
im not cringe im just being real and if reality is cringe to you than thats your problem not mine
like 90% of casters will have 1% haste in the beginning, after crafting nimble thought bracers
you nerds would gain more dps by taking care of your mental health and body eg by going outside for once rather than by malding over theoretical gains that will be overshadowed by your practical incompetence anyway
when youre runecrafting AND lockcord is having the 5th haste maldown in the last 4 days 🤡 🔫
I precisely know that I could be running from the bank to the altar just by one click by activating the runelite plug in, it was an active decision not to do so and not lack of knowledge
whats wrong with my pouches?
im not wasting any time because all of my actions happen within 1 game tick
the point of parsing, at least beyond the display of basic capability, is to cyberboost ones ego and gain attention, and ur kinda feeding into just that
people in guilds that are still 8/10 or 9/10 must actually somewhat like each other otherwise they wouldve disbanded after the 3rd id without 10/10 so they are to be respected on some level
haste is communist because its linear and not exponential like a capitalist would like it to be

you can also boweave with soul shatter which has high synergy with boweaving because of the massive dps spike caused by bowiz proc

Honestly. I need to say something. This star farming battle needs to end. We have lost sight of what is truly important. Shitposting. The starboard stood as a bastion for this greats discords annals for the finest fecal laced posts ever produced. The star board was never about power or fame. I never reached top of the start board looking for fame, I did it for the love of the shitpost. Nowadays all we focus on is numbers. We infight over getting to the starboard, our standards have slipped for the sake of a proxy war. We need to settle our differences and coexist together. As posters and consumers of shit.

"why cant I keep up with the other warlock"
he set his spellqueue to 60 or something
isnt it funny
how this spellqueue things
makes more actual difference than any of the garbage about haste and item prios that has been talked about yet again today
massive brain pvper
in sunwell when you pick up heart of the pit (offhand) thats a 26 dps increase vs chronicle, which is more of an increase than ZD is vs ToC
when you have ZD in sunwell its awkward to pick up that item you basically cant do it
because you dont have a 1h weapon to make it worth
r u kidding
that ZA weapon is way inferior than ToC
well by that logic the whole discussion is void because youll have both weapons
also ur wrong anyway
so how long do you think phase 3+4 will be?
say a number of months
ok I can help you
does 5 months sound good to you?
so 6 months?
lol
ur insane if you think it will be more than 6 months until swp
6 months is 24 ids is exactly 4 ZDs for the average guild
so you have boomkin, ele, shadow and mage covered
ur not getting a ZD
same
not if you dont hit the movement speed breakpoint of breaking the chains 1 tick earlier
who cares about 0.2s boss uptime when we're already gimping our dps in the mid triple digit area by wearing shadow res
8 shadow res
if he doesnt get ported at all, which can totally happen, the 8 shadow res at least does something, the movement speed does nothing
lower incoming shadow dmg
from the other shadow abilities the boss does
or its also possible that you get hit by chain aoe while not being the one teleported
btw this discussion is not about 8 shadow res vs minor speed
its about exchanging already existing 8 shadow res for minor speed
My guild stopped dragging vashj to Bagdad P1 2 weeks ago
But not because its effective, you do actually die very quickly with no SR when you get ported, like definitely hard to survive as warlock, but people will run 0 SR for parsing and pray they dont get ported
Ur not in range for them
On pserver the rule for pugs was (long after release) if you die to chains and get caught wearing less than 3 SR pieces no loot from the boss
1 piece is like 40 sr
Usually u wear neck, cloak and bracers
People underestimate how long it can take 3 dadgamers to break the chain by running AWAY from each other
That said I think 150 unbuffed is fine and spot on if you're not giga retarded at running + use boots, healthstone, pot etc
For progress yes
Later less should do, especially if more people in the raid have boots too
and that is
well technically its Seymour telling him
I mean technically that can happen but in most cases the player with a bit less haste (and its only marginal differences that are to be discussed since most items and setups are undisputed) will just take whatever downside extending the cast time has and squeeze out another shadowbolt anyway.
cataclysm scales with haste
fire is losing constantly
its not your assumptions on fire vs shadow are based on simulations which are manipulated in a way that favours fire eg by leaving cataclysm out for shadow, assuming less than realistic isb uptime or not considering boweaving
so what isb uptime do you assume then
but with isb stacker its 100%?
you just need enough of them whats even the difference of having isb stackers (= causing someone to have personal dps loss for your own personal gain) vs having someone stack scorch, if you look at the nature of both things, theres no difference, they are literally the same, youre griefing's someone dps for your own benefit by having them stack something, so either you accept the possibility of an isb stacker for the comparison or you consider mage personal dps loss caused by casting scorch when doing the comparison to shadow, and at that point my compagnon fire loses real hard
the concept of exchanging someone elses dps for your own is the same, the isb stacker just needs to gem enough crit and they will be a positive contribution to isb uptime
just gem orange
Why do people always talk about gear, gemming, fire/shadow - all that has been talked about in the last few days is within 50 dps, it literally doesnt matter, why do people not talk about playing p3 bosses and trash correctly eg positioning, specific rotational considerations for each encounter, doom v agony, where to use sappers/nades, implications for boweaving. I believe such discussions would lead to a lot more actual dps gain for everyone participating.
most fights arent as long you think they are when youre observing the effects of haste, just because the combat log makes it seem that way, doesnt mean it applies to haste in that manner, whenever you have to stop casting the fight stops and when you begin casting again a new fight starts, ros at first glance is a 5 minute fight but actually its 3 rather short fights that add up to 5 minutes, illidan is a 10 minute fight consisting of 6-7 fights, a 3 minute 2 shield najentus is 3 smaller fights, I could go on but I guess you get the point
its not "still" a thing, it only gets better because it scales with haste
Taking that point seriously, what does everyone think is the ideal way to play Naj'entus?
ok since this channel doesnt function unless opinions exists which people can object to make others look bad, here are some takes on how to play najentus:

1) Your raid leader will ask you to spread out for Najentus, this means that there is a danger of your boomkin and ele totems wandering off to locations where they are no longer in range, make sure that you are at a position where those are in range while still standing spread enough and also if you think standing in the offside like a loner is a nice play - if you get hit by the spine your chances of getting freed by your other raidmembers are higher when youre located in the center of things rather than next to a wall where noone will notice you. Find a somewhat central but not too central position. You can also find a spine buddy with who you agree you will pick each other's spine if you one of you gets hit. Then dont pick other people's spine because picking spines is dps loss so fuck them.

2) Incoming raid dmg can be quite high at this boss so blood fury should be used carefully, at least for the first kill.

3) Tidal shield has a 60 second cooldown, so if you doom at pull it will most likely hit the shield. Use CoA first, then doom. Research in logs about kill times to see if a second doom is worth or if agony or nothing is the play.

4) The temptation is high to life tap while the tidal shield is up but that can also very easily kill you, because people will throw the spine while youre not done tapping and not topped off. Also its questionable if you tapping is worth it when it means the whole raid has to wait for you finishing your tapping. What you can do though is ask your druid for example to lifebloom you just before the shield comes up, so you are quickly topped off after tapping. Another thing you can do is take nightmare seed when the shield comes up. It extends your HP pool, making you more likely to survive despite tapping.

Lamentably Im about to hit the character limit so I cant really add mor
what
I wrote elaborations on najentus that will lead to more dps gain than for example gemming red vs yellow, or toc vs zd. I simmed discussions on actual gameplay vs gearing and the former won clearly. So I dont know why 95% of the time spent discussing is allocated to the later. It just doesnt make sense. Youre all wasting your time for nothing
without line breaks I could have written "more" instead of just "mor", if you dont hit the breakpoint where you can actually finish your words and sentences with line breaks in, its not efficient to use them
not using line breaks is basically gaining haste rating
So since nobody objected the content of my post you all agree that points 1) to 4) in my post are the optimal way to play najentus and we can move on to the next boss? Or any more aspects to add?
ok since this channel doesnt function unless opinions exists which people can object to make others look bad, here are some takes on how to play najentus:

- make sure your support auras are in range while still standing spread
- make sure someone picks your spine, dont waste too much time picking other ppls spine
- agony then doom
- use blood fury carefully or not at all for 1st kill
- somehow manage to tap during tidal shield without dying or delaying the spine throw
git gud
ok guys since we managed to finish najentus in this lesson Im going to go shopping, here's your homework: thoughts on how to play supremus, what can be done at supremus specifically to increase dps?
if you find aspects of warlock gameplay that apply to this boss specifically, you will get a fox, wolf or bear sticker on your homework, if you only manage to mention aspects which apply to warlock in general, I will have to give you a turtle or chicken sticker
I dont write slow, I'm a 2 times winner of my school's yearly typewriting contest
well at typwriting contests - which I happen to be a veteran of - all you have to do is copy already existing text, so its a different game, but it proves that I could write faster than most if it was my priority to do so
it was a business type of school with things like business administration, so you can call it that if you want
when talking about haste breakpoints noone ever considers the fact that most players will not go for hitting any breakpoints by small margins, you may be decent at estimating incoming damage, but most players when they are faced with the question: "Do I cast another shadowbolt even though it looks like it may be too late to hit the boss?" will not go for it, because casting shadowbolts that dont end up hitting causes gigantic cost of opportunity to materialize. Most people will just use shadowburn instead, with which they can throw in a boweave, another aspect people arent considering
not if its the finish to the encounter and you still have enough time to lifetap afterwards, Im casting about 150 shadowburns each raid which is why I start each raid with at least 75 shards in my inventory and my bank is full of shards so I can restock when moving from raid instance A to raid instance B (eg from ssc to tk), the other warlocks are not doing that and thats why they are losing and why our guild is still 8/10
depends, pw style its 1, fights like kael could be more than 5, Im also observing the effects of using shadowburn mid rotation to throw in a boweave, should also be worth but unfortunately its not included in @Kristofer 's sim
yes
in most cases you start with bow, but sometimes you dont, examples: morogrim you start with regular weapon and switch to bow when youre tapping up for the murlocs, kael you dont want bow proc at thaladred because the movement tends to make you not make good use of the proc
yes
its very worth on single target it procs at or before the 5th cast in 55.6% of the cases which is very fast, only in 10% of the cases it will not have procced after 20 seconds or so, so in the vast majority of cases you get to proc it while lust, trinkets, blood fury and destro pots are on, which is very stronk, also since the proc makes you cast faster you will on average experience a quagg's eye proc sooner, so it has advanced synergy with other things
show sim configuration for that claim
well, at least I did my own math, wheres yours
I did some napkin math and thoughts on bowiz. So even though Hildis isnt doing his job by adding bowiz weaving to the sim I can definitely say that bowiz weaving is worth it on single target in a PW style fight. There is a 68% chance that you can get both your bowiz to proc and to make full use of the proc before the first 20 seconds of the encounter, during which you are lusted. That's 7 casts which last 1.92 seconds + 4 casts that are affected by lust and proc (4x1.63), in total thats 19.96 seoncds. Why is 20 seconds important? Because thats when you still have your 144 spellpower from icon active and switching (GCD) while thats active is in most cases not worth it. Having bowiz active here is a 3564 damage gain, since your average shadow bolts are hitting for 5900 during that time as per sim and the 4 bowiz affected casts during lust let you cast an additional 0.6 shadow bolts which is equal to 3564 damage. The cost of opportunity - in my case - is not wearing bloodmaw mageblade for those 20 seconds. That costs me about 75 dps compared to the raw stats of bowiz (raw stats = if bowiz was just a stat stick that doesnt have a proc it would be about 75 dps worse than bloodmaw during lust). So the cost of opportunity of wearing bowiz compared to mageblade is about 1500 damage. If bowiz doesnt proc and I weave it out after 20 seconds by tapping (which at some point I have to do anyway in a PW style fight), I've lost 1500 damage. The chance of that happening is 32%. If it does proc I gain around 3500 damage, minus cost of opportunity that equals to a 2000 damage gain. So its a 2000 damage gain happening 68% of the time (1360 average gain) vs 1500 damage loss happening 32% of the time (480 average loss). It should also be worth it to just keep bowiz equipped if you are unlucky and it doesnt proc within 20 seconds, but this example makes it obvious that its in general worth doing.
obviously its less worth when the cost of opportunity is higher, dont need math for that
doesnt mean that it isnt STILL WORTH
you made your claim first so its your turn to provide anything
heres the thing: when I did my math whenever I had to make assumptions which by the nature of not having access to proper simulations had to be "eductated guesses", so basically all I did is make sure that Im using conservative values, so that I can definitely prove the worth of boweaving using a t4 weapon, I am very confident this napkin math works well enough for this more obvious case, but with t6 weapons things can be so close that Im not going to act like napkin math is doing the matter at hand justice, only a proper simulation would
no but im offering a picture of my cat to whoever adds boweaving to hildis sim
now you cant say that Im making demands only, not contributing
the value of a picture of a cat my be close to 0 but its certainly >0
so Im contributing
in 1 year of farming sunwell on private we had 0 sunfire robe pattern drops, even after they upped the droprate of sunwell recipes because they felt sorry for everyone
no Im a main healer so I was healing with my resto shaman, this warlock thing is just a side gig for me and ill return to healing in wrath
yes you can trashfarm it and we did so still it didnt drop, sure it increases your odds but they arent good to begin with, so have fun wanting to kill yourself farming some robe pattern in the most annoying trash while wrath is knocking on the door
my bis chestpiece pattern for resto shaman also never dropped
I will literally delete my character if more than 20% of you manage to grab a sunfire robe before wrath hits
pleas no
Even vs JC neck its like 15 dps upgrade
which is why I gave the homework to brainstorm on supremus, and yet the channel digressed to the 40th maldown on haste at the first opportunity it had
you will see more glaives than sunfire robes, and sunfire robe pattern is tradeable so you could in theory also buy it for 100k gold or something, so its not just about dps difference, its about showing off your giant peepee, if you walk laps in shattrath with sunfire robe on, you will AT LEAST get 5 female belfs following you each lap
too fat to keep up with sunfire robe chad running laps in shatt
dwarves dont have the confidence to follow sunfire robe chad though, theyll resign to following the next best JC neck enjoyer
he made fun of you
then he got 1shot by multishot at vashj
generally im pretty depressed, but when a mage gets oneshot by multishot I see the light of life for a second
I simmed breaking christmas ceasefire and it ended up not so good
by breaking christmas ceasefire you make the other party very angry and sad, it motivates them even more to win which has higher value than the value you gain out of breaking the ceasefire
breaking contracts is never good
pacta sunt servanda
immolate because of benig a dot adds "consistency" to your dps, just spamming shadowbolt has higher highs and lower lows, so basically youre a boring normie if you cast immolate, if you cast shadowbolt only you at least have a *chance* to make a difference in this miserable world
I would rather at least try and fail than be a failure of a warlock to begin with
Like dude, I get it. You’re so deep into this anti boweaving thing that you can’t find your way out anymore, you're past the point of no return. You interpret facts as fiction - maybe a conspiracy even - and admitting you're wrong would be such an ego shattering event that your mind has to protect you from such harm. You’re basically an anti vaxxer but worse, an anti boweaver. I get it. But let's reset and get the facts straight. I made the claim that boweaving on single target is worth when using a T4 weapon. I supported my claim with very convincing napkin math. The quality of my napkin math is supported by the fact that noone ever contested it's content. Not one single person out of 8 Billion people on earth. So basically, boweaving being worth on ST when wearing a T4 weapon is a fact. It's as much of a fact as 2+2 being 4 is, which noone is contesting either. And I never even claimed more than that. You on the other hand Mr. "My dps comes naturally even without boweaving" hereby just made the claim that boweaving is ONLY worth up to T4 weapons. You backed up your claim with nothing. Nothing, not even hearsay, just nothing. Poof. It's basically like when you're being asked on the street by a stranger if the bookstore is still open and you respond with "yes" even though you didnt even know a bookstore existed in your town. I fully realize that being a warlock trainer and such you don't want to confuse the lost souls that come here to ask innocent questions with advanced technology like boweaving, but you're also doing just that with  fire warlock, so it's inconsistent to neglect the one while embracing the other. But being new to boweaving, it's very understandable you do that. Very. I, Mayhem, understand you, Ryusei. At the end of the day we are both just human beings, who make mistakes. So I invite you to admit: The correct answer to the question you have been asked would have been: "I don't know." And nothing more than that. And no, Ryu, I don't know either.
in my country its €20 per semester unless you take too long then its 300-400 euros
the trick is to use student loan to gamble with options on stonks
immolate because of benig a dot adds "consistency" to your dps, just spamming shadowbolt has higher highs and lower lows, so basically youre a boring normie if you cast immolate, if you cast shadowbolt only you at least have a chance to make a difference in this miserable world
in my country we just pump water up to mountain lakes
you just bring a decent amount and adjust as needed thats what everyone with a half a brain does
https://youtu.be/kXJAxhl5V9E this but with wow
do I look like a dancing bear to you you 🤡
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/hp9X7PLybncRrH1D#fight=48&type=damage-done&translate=true
hunters are 🤡
the first haste ring is like a 40 dps upgrade its pretty big
tier is giga big upgrade aswell but much higher drop %
slippers are like 35 dps upgrade not to neglect either
personally, after skull and one of the weapons, slippers will be the item I kinda care most about, followed right after first haste ring, slippers drop % is pretty damn shit, I believe a lot of people are sleeping on how big of an upgrade slipeers are vs how hard they are to obtain
I simmed it yesterday was 35 dps upgrade
gemming spellpower is good especially if you get 2 lusts everytime
but orange is decent aswell
the chance of slippers dropping is 1/7, even though haste rings are kinda rare, you will get way more of them than just 1 in 7 raids, so even though haste ring is 40 dps upgrade and slippers "only" 35, if I had the choice, Id want slippers first
!mayo
@mayo have you even considered for a second how contested red epic gems will be vs orange gems?
this is literally the kind of behaviour that makes guilds be 8/10
there we go, my guild is asking to server trans, server is dead but apparently not dead enough for blizzard to offer free transfer
fuck blizzard
bobby suck a fat one
this is so retarded I dont want to pay 25 or 17.5 euros or whatever for what should be free, I already pay monthly and its their job to make sure players I can play with exist in their mmo, luckily im pumper enough that my guild would just pay the transfer for me but thats not how I roll, doesnt change the fact that that money ends up in bobbys crakcharem either
I was GM of a pretty mediocre guild on mirage raceway in classic for almost a year, it was either that or guild disband because the actual gm wasnt doing anything. While I wanted to speedrun most others did shit like collecting garbo tier sets because thats cooler than items with actual stats. It wasnt a great fit and I quit with aq, also because of wbuffs. The guild exists to this day and they barely managed 9/10 before p2.5. I kinda respect it but god Im glad I left that behind me.
I wasnt about stacking classes and stuff, but trying to improve cleartime every single week.. and others were mostly snails kinda. I was playing healer and I often pulled trashpacks and even bosses sometimes because I was sick of pointless waiting
alright so its official my guild is transferring server so either I suck it up and pump even more money into bobby's harem or I have to go look for a new guild on this deadass server nice
from lucifron to venoxis
german servers
my stance was that if Im going to fund bobby's harem even more then at least for firemaw
horde
I dont trust gehennas faction balance for WOTLK
I wish transfers didnt exist in the first place
wow community is ruining servers just by themselves, circletransing like idiots and blizzard is just standing there with open hands for sperg money
I just dont want to be paying for another transfer in a year or so yet again and since wotlk seems to be alliance favored for racials, I can see gehennas pulling a lucifron
should have just stayed on my original server mirage raceway
yeah the GM is arguing that its impossible to recruit people on this server I mean ok, but he also hasnt explored the recruitment method of actually having an enjoyable raid so that people dont leave the guild and you dont have to find new people, I dont think it will be any different on a server with a higher pop
what is that, razorfen?
Im considering making the GM pay for our transfer or at least a portion of it, this is the sort of basis for negotiation you have when being a boweaving catabolt chad
wtf thats even more dead than lucifron
"server is shit" is such a welcome excuse for bad guild leadership
not gonna deny that recruiting on our server sucks, but I dont think the situation is any different on most other servers
if your guild and raid is actually enjoyable, people will not quit/leave the guild
thats what our gm has been doing and it has been working for the recruitment side but hes also very strong on the de-recruitment side if you know what I mean
even if that works, I would much rather play in a more stable roster
on pserver we had better raid setups with like less than half the players lucifron has
coming from pserver noone can tell me u cant build a decent raid with 2500 active raiding characters on your server
the amount of bad players on classic is definitely overwhelming and many are not just bad in terms of gameplay, but also lacking the understanding of the teamplay necessary to make a raiding guild work in this addon, they worry too much about loot, dont understand the purpose of their class and apparently boss parses are giga important and noone cares about overall performance including trash
ill kid you not boomers exist that think they are hot shit because they have barely purple boss parses
and theyll make demands based off of that
my previous guild disenchanted best in slot items because people were saving retarded ass points for DST, the player leading in points never picked up a single item for points up until the guild disbanded because of still being 8/10 in the 4th p2 id, what then happened was one of the most amazing experiences Ive had so far
because the guild was breaking apart we had to add pugs to the last gruul raid and because of that we couldnt use said point system
DST dropped and the guy that saved up all of his points lost the roll to a pug
he was fuming
it was so amazing, I sent him salt ingame afterwards
per mail
noone cared enough to think of it ig
he was the kind of guy that barely parses purple sometimes and thinks hes hot shit, I saw him at aldor bank a few days ago, inspected him and to my joy saw that he still doesnt have DST, and hes raiding with a guild that isnt even any better than the one that disbanded due to 8/10 stuck
I should send him some more salt for christmas
maybe he was trying to add boweaving :thonk:
he could add boweaving as a DLC to the sim and Id buy it
I am more ready to pay €17.50 to Hildi for a boweaving sim DLC than I am to pay the same amount to Blizzard to actually be able to play the game again by server transferring
my server wasnt considered dead enough
2350 active characters in WCL
(for horde, alliance is 0)
it would be fine if people werent so doomer about the future of the server, more and more are transferring off and its certainly gonna end in a snowball effect
them calling it a dead server while it wasnt actually a dead server is becoming a self fulfilling prophecy
to people when you cant fill an underbog non heroic group at 4 am on a workday, its a dead server automatically
honestly this wow classic community is one of the shittiest gaming communities Ive experienced in all of gaming, and yes I have played league of legends, and at least when someone in a game of league is asking me to kill myself, I know that they care about the game, meanwhile so many are halfassing WoW classic that its beyond me as to why someone can choose to play the game that way, they pay a monthly fee to blizzard to play the game, then they pay goldfarmers so they dont have to play the game outside of raiding and then when they do go raiding they put up a pathetic show, I honestly have no idea how it can even get more clown than that
you will do more dps by just gemming orange and allocating the resources you spend on worrying about red v yellow to other things like thinking through boss specific gameplay choices

My rank phase 1 and people shit on catabolt 🤡
Got a vaccuum cleaning robot (called him "Dobby") and a hammock to chill in while he does my work pretty good combo
He needs to do about 25 runs to reach the breakpoint at which hes cheaper than paying someone to do it
I rerolled from healer
classic warlocks pathetic
they do beat our dps in sunwell
cleave in sunwell mostly relevant for m'uru and kj only
what trash
after kalec not a lot of trash
not as relevant as in bt, t5
no
I did the maths when I wanted to prove that nethervoid -> illidari cloak is the most irrelevant upgrade you can get, so I went through every single upgrade and came to 50 dps gain for skull
if you intend to use ZD not having skull hurts a lot more than with ToC though
but it always hurts skull>everything
just shut up, why do you keep making claims w/o sim, just the same garbo as when you went on a 2 hour ramble on how nethervoid cloak is not the best simming cloak out of all p3 cloaks when otherwise wearing p2 bis gear, never providing config because you were on your "phone"
people are also giga incapable of making proper comparisons, they will do shit like unequip skull and change it for icon... ok... now you lost a crapton of hit so you need hit and then what they will do is fucking gem hit instead of looking for more efficient options for gaining said hit, eg swapping best of belt of blasting, equippping nethervoid, if youre not gonna be aiming to make the absolute best case for all the options you would like to compare, dont even begin because its a waste of time
no you can make reasonable compromises elsewhere to gain hit so its not as bad, its just still the most juicy item because with skull you dont have to make any compromises for hit, its straight up the best item with hit slammed on top, when you have full bis with ZD and youre lacking skull, picking up skull would be a 48 dps gain, for the ToC variant it would be a 33 dps gain, which makes perfect sense because not having the hit from skull in ToC variant is kinda irrelevant
boweaving is not in hildis sim so its not considered, obviously if we could consider boweaving, it might change the whole game, nobody knows, maybe with boweaving we should actually be using the darkmoon trinket, its a possibility, nobody can make such a claim because you cant use the sim to back it up because it lacks boweaving, but also nobody can dispute the POSSIBILITY of boweaving being the bis playstyle causing the darkmoon trinket to be the bis trinket, you cant rule out the possibility because you cant prove otherwise
yes, the cult does what the sims say, always
the average time it takes to proc bowiz is infinite though, the proc rate of bowiz is 15%, Im not aware of other proc mechanics, so in theory, you could buy bowiz and never get it to proc, not a single time in your life, 1500 gold and opportunity cost dps wasted, that is absolutely POSSIBLE, this means on average, since infinite number goes quite far, the average time for bowiz proc is infinite
since when are outliers not included in averages
but if infinite is one of the outliers, the average will also be infinite
My guild wants to transfer server to a more alive pvp server (Venoxis), our server Lucifron has been bleeding only, I think pve server pop is more stable and would prefer such a server like Razorfen (pvp aspect kinda w/e to me, my point is population stability), what do you think?
1 - Transfer with guild to Venoxis (balanced pvp, 4750 active raidchars, negative player trend)
2 - Transfer to Razorfen and find new guild (balanced pve, 2835 active raid chars, positive player trend)
3 - Stay on Lucifron, find new guild and thug it out until free trans
4 - quit WoW
lol what
the concept of open world pvp is dense as shit
this is exactly what lucifron is and its dying
my observation is that generally people like balanced pvp servers, but eventually, the balance breaks and one faction dies, what then happens is that the remaining faction just bleeds to death because people dont want to start on a super unbalanced server
I have observed that unbalanced pve servers remain stable even when the faction balance is bad, because it doesnt matter, mirage raceway for example has had stable population basically throughout all of classic for both factions
the server isnt as dead as the guild leader is clamining but the decline is starting to get real, hes saying that its impossible to recruit on our server, and I agree its probably not easy at all, recruitment happens mostly by picking up leftovers from guilds falling appart, but he hasnt observed the recruitment method of actually providing a half decent raid environment and treating other people like humans so that people dont leave/quit causing him to have to recruit, also I raise the question if our server is so dead, then how are we only rank 21 for ssc clear speed lol
Venoxis Horde population has been declining also, the only thing saving it is people transferring from even deader servers like lucifron
5658 -> 4750 in 3 months? okcoper
the whole point of the transfer is the GM not finding people to recruit, but I believe it will be exactly the same thing on any server with declining population, even if theres a lot more population, when its declining that means that all guilds are recruiting anything they can find
it looks to me like people circlejerk rotate between pvp servers every other quarter, clowning noone but themselves by funneling blizzard transfer money, thats why Im inclined to play on a big stable pve server
lol what
its 1 year max
bruh at some point you have to move on, other games exist
also look how old the playerbase is getting, literally noone new starts playing wow, if you keep playing you will just degen along with everyone else, as I get older I would rather play with younger people so I dont degen as much
whatever the cool kids play these days
that tiktok game seems to be popular rn
dont have one of those touchy phones tho
my gm still hasnt done the alar step he forgets every single raid, when he was suggested to just write a WA he said its others people fault for not reminding him and thats what should be happening
prot warrior
hes not giga shit and he would have a bear with equal gear, but hes the typical "muh warrior" clown who would go to populated places to "flex" his t5 gear and high unbuffed hp pool
one time he brought the bear to the raid and the raid went badly, the fact that the raid went bad had nothing to do with the bear, yet he concluded it was a mistake to go bear, his way of finding conclusions works like that all the time, he has a pre set opinion and is willing to take anything to spin things the way he wanted from the first place, while pretending he was open minded about it

I think in terms of playing tanks hes ok and not an issue RL I dont think at all
have you simmed nether prot v swiftness potion? Imo if with swiftness potion you can hit the movementspeed breakpoint of breaking the chains earlier, it could be the better play
sorry I meant shadow prot
im on a maldelirium high so words are harder rn
making the split second decision of which potion to use based on the classes that Im being ported with is a bit beyond my gamer capabilities I will have to admit :hang:
I think if you consider the dmg loss per shadow resistance with all the resgear youre wearing, its a bit incoherent to use damage increasing pots, FA is literally the only thing that should kill you and this is where the resources should go, for example it would probably be worth more to wear a bit less res (therefore more dmg) and use a defensive pot on FA, than to use a dmg pot and more res in general
why would you do that, it will get used up by irrelevant shadow dmg abilities
and then its not up for port
what, explain
oh you mean like taking 2 min before pull I get it
well I believe you underestimate the amount of griefing potential FA unlocks for your teammates, and youre playing a class immobile outside of 5 min cd on rocket boots, so I believe using destros and manas will result in less FAs casted on you, simply because you cant get it after having died to the first one
the thing that will happen is that at first you run in direction A and your teammate happens to be doing the same thing, so you both at the same time choose to run to direction B instead, but then youre still chained and together, and so on, unless you have psychic powers able to read the other persons mind, you two may end up looking more clown than you think you will, even when otherwise capable
I mean either way even with these idiot proof technologies, I would keep the potion cd ready for FA for the first kill at least, and thats coming from a player usually tending to the more risky playstyle
dont have keybindings for this because of boweaving taking about extra 10 keybindings, but putting it in a macro with shadow prot pot, healthstone and rocket boots could be the way to ensure youre pressing it
correct
it literally says Texas on the doormat you bonobos
!mayo
I think shooting for council cloak is delusional, otherwise looks fine, may want to coordinate with other warlocks about ToC route because inevitably you need some to go that route, or you waste a lot of potential in raid gearing

karazhan enjoyers the real mvps
Nowerdays :thonk:
I had 99.2 pest perf avg in P1 and 96 median (despite later joining boomer dadguild) playing shadow catabolt that was when fire was strongest, if you believe its worth to go through the extra steps required for fire at this point, youre god damn delusional
Im trying to sleep in the hammock I got
Havent simmed bed v hammock yet though
the average player quality in classic is the most garbage Ive ever seen, I looked at the cast timelines and mana bar of a new ele we brought last raid and he doesnt even know his "rotation" and is too stupid to use mana pot, like he would start with 5x LB and then only sporadically without a clear pattern cast CL, yet his *pArSeS* dont look that bad, because it gets covered by raid dps and 90% of everyone else parsing is incapable of basic gameplay too
was that PTR? because if on PTR you start at 0 rep, thats not what you do ingame, youre basically friendly already
point of PTR is not testing speedrunning strats!!1
guys there is so much talk about mother in this channel, which I guess makes sense because it requires extra prep, but there are 12 other bosses in p3, why never talk about boss specific consideration regarding bosses other than mother? for example do you have armor scrolls and nightmare seed prepared to survive gurtogg?
just transfer the points to cataclysm and join sb spamming, anything else is not worth worrying about
beware, ur about to summon rysusei and get to know his esoteric take on it
70% isb uptime is too low at this point
ur assuming the other warlocks have his gear
we're heading towards 90% ISB uptime in T6, in sunwell maybe even up to 110%
just spamming sbolt is definitely better, even if using immo was a 20 dps gain or something, youll probably lose that dps because having to think of a 2nd button is causing you to misexecute
ZD is the bigger dps gain but skull is more important in the grand scheme of things
so you snapshot last sec of bowiz proc and hellfire?
BOWEAVING CONFIRMED OP
"Boweaving" is the terminus technicus for weaving Blade of Wizardry ("bowiz") in and out of your character's weapon slot during an encounter. Normally weapon swaps cause a global cooldown to occur, typically resulting in a loss of dps uptime if the weapon is swapped during combat. Thus it typically is inefficient to swap your weapon while you're intending to cast spells. This is not the case if the weapon swap is combined with the global cooldown of a spell eg life tap, shadowburn or soul shatter. Both actions can be performed at the same time. If you swap your weapon together with a spell that you would have used anyway, no loss of uptime can be attributed to the weapon swap. This means that you can start out fights wielding bowiz, wait for the proc to happen and then weave it out for a weapon with stronger stats, as a result - most of the time - skipping the majority of the 50 second inner cooldown that bowiz has. A successful performance of said actions is called a "boweave" and causes bowiz to be a much stronger weapon than it normally would be. After bowiz has come off the inner cooldown, another boweave can be performed for another proc. Jpaint kind of smells. The proc rate of bowiz is 15%, meaning that bowiz will proc at or before the 5th cast in more than 56% of cases. This causes boweaving to be a dps gain even in single target encounters. Here's an example. Warlock A: "How is warlock C dealing so much damage? I just can't keep up with him and I'm the one dooming!" Warlock B: "He's probably boweaving again..." Warlock A: "That must be it, I forgot that he's a master boweaver."
christmas is late this year
15%
it doesnt have to be lifetap tho, it could be anything, for example at najentus you know that you want to agony first because otherwise doom will pop in the shield, so know you have a guaranteed no uptime loss weave opportunity 24 seconds into the fight when you place your doom
@jpaint What actual real world fake pixels dps difference are you even going to get from "understanding haste"? You can gem differently and then there are MAYBE 2 whole items you can swap based on which religion of haste understanding you're following. The difference will be 20 dps if even that. You have been MALDING about haste ever since christmas holidays began. Can you even imagine how much dps you could have been gaining in all that time by trying to get in depth understandings of boss mechanics in p3 and finding the optimal way to play them as a warlock? There are always little things you can do that others aren't thinking of and often they will make way more than 20 dps difference. Even on a fight like pre nerf Vashj I have seen up to 300 dps difference in warlock dps (same gear, both on doom/coa) that came just from playing the encounter well vs playing it poorly. Why are you for example not discussing the ideal split second decisions to make when being affected by Gurtogg Bloodboil's Fel Rage (eg use nightmare seed, change to tank flask). Not dying at Gurtogg Bloodboil equals to a lot more dps than knowing the haste break points you would have met had you not died at Gurtogg Bloodboil. Another thing is consumables. Are you even pumping dark/demonic runes whenever you can? As per simulations using dark runes deals 25 dps. And here you are discussing things that will maybe make 10 dps difference, while probably not using dark runes always. It would be the more efficient play to be farming dark runes rather than spending your time here learning how to maybe deal 10 more dps. Honestly, just for the sake of discussion efficiency, anyone who cant provide a weekly screenshot of 50 dark/demonic runes should be banned from discussion in this channel. The ignorance about the dps efficiency of discussions has been going too far. All you "theorycrafters" are literally doing is crafting theory. Practical play is what crafts actual mastery and dps results.
I dont have nitro and I posted it
you got jpants name twice there
depends on if im shitting or not
so quiet, everyone went to farm runes 🙃
yes
Ok boomer
Not using mouseovers is just straight up bad theres no discussion to be had (Im healer main btw this warlock thing is just a side gig)
You're not doing it as well as you could
cat is a lot stronger here and now than people think, its just that noone plays it properly
the fuck is "normal spec"? you can tell cultism is going too far when this is the way you think ("normal" v "abnormal"). potentially 5/5 cata has value always. you dont have to necessarily ever use whatever "normal spec" contains. I have been tanking Leo with 5/5 cata w/o issue. Just dont be garbo at the game and youre fine
people are fine running esoteric immolate but will deny soul leech value or cataclysm value, the 🤡 emote doesnt go far enough to describe what is going on here, this discord is basically a clown car and more and more of you 🤡 s are crawling out of it the longer Im reading it, unbelievable
what are you even simming to get these low dps numbers, fire mage?
also you gain haste so there will be more casts = more crits 🙃
if people in this channel wanted to actually do something of significance once, they would take a shower, not discuss matters of 5 dps difference
ISB uptime will be up bigly next phase, with haste everything comes together in ways simulations cant comprehend
your brain is just a low level simulation of how you think things are gonna go down
if you think your ideal gem is yellow, or if you think its red, then congratz you won at best 10 dps, or at least you think you did, you dont have a way to prove it causally anyway, but at least you got a peace for your mind I guess? red and yellow gems are a lot more contested gems than orange, they will be north of 1k gold, while orange is gonna sit at 500 or so. scale that to your whole gearing and youre spending thousands of gold for that tiny little difference. the cost of opportunity in terms of what you could do with that gold is immense, let alone the cost of opportunity by overthinking this matter. just gemming orange is the most efficient play in a meta choice context and its gonna be reasonably close to whatever gemming setup is theoretically "the best"
spellhaste for all healers, rogue hit, warrior crit, mage int
cata v immo is not p3 talk lmao
I have been running cata since crossroads, phase 1 my avg best perf was 99.2, my median 96.3 - running cata - absolutely servicable and effective since ALWAYS, not just p3
PHASE 1 CATA, IMMOLATE NOT EVEN BOUND, SO BAD :Incinerate: 🤡 :Incinerate:
being a ToC enjoyer and skull haver is the highest % play within any reasonably organized raidgroup
owning atiesh means having played classic unironically, so most of the time theyre boomers and not pumpers
:100:  this will lead to a lot bigger dps improvements than basically anything discussed here, theorycrafting will probably squeeze out low double digit numbers of dps improvements at best, position incorrectly and have to walk 5 yards and you lost all theoreycrafted advantage, anyone capable of elementary school math will get 98% of the gearing correct, the biggest advantages you can get are about the actual gameplay happening, not haste v spell gems
you can practice by yourself using rank 1 SB on mobs so you dont kill them
I noticed that people love discussing things in detail that barely matter in the grand scheme of things, it seems to me that things that matter more for actual in raid DPS output get neglected or get taken for granted even if they really arent, so I made this pyramid where you can go from bottom to top to see if youre being efficient with what youre worrying about, bottom parts act as a foundation for whats above, this is just a first draft and the order can slightly vary based on your personal circumstances
kinda agree but also kinda depends on your hardware
well many install custom interface and it ends up being worse than just going with standard interface
actually the first haste you pick up will be the most effictive
Sir, this is a simming cult. In phase 2 gear nimble thought bracers sim 24 dps higher than alar bracers. So we equip nimble thought as soon as we can. And even if the difference wasn't as clear, what sims best is to be equipped and not to be questioned.
here you have it haste explained in one picture now lets leave this topic behind us for 2022 please 🙏
there is no bad or good side there is chaos and order and in chaos there is order, and in order there is chaos, I thought everyone here was a non-functioning doomer that read jordan peterson's "12 rules for life" at least to the part where he goes non stop on about bible shit
chaos can be good
prime example: chaotic skyfire diamond
tbh playing physical in hyjal waves isnt gonna be fun in the first place, you deal like only a 3rd of the dmg bombers do and for like half the waves you have to pray youre not gonna get killed by something

honestly this wow classic community is one of the shittiest gaming communities Ive experienced in all of gaming, and yes I have played league of legends, and at least when someone in a game of league is asking me to kill myself, I know that they care about the game, meanwhile so many are halfassing WoW classic that its beyond me as to why someone can choose to play the game that way, they pay a monthly fee to blizzard to play the game, then they pay goldfarmers so they dont have to play the game outside of raiding and then when they do go raiding they put up a pathetic show, I honestly have no idea how it can even get more clown than that, why play the game if youre not actually playing the game?
if crix publishes that boweaving video, he wont be able to resist and come back
I thought drums tinnitus was fine and then they also did the 8yd thing for absolutely no reason, blizzard too stupid for anything
most of the time you dont even want to be stacked like that
and its not worth moving just for the drums, you probably lose more uptime than gain
if it was about something bigger yes, but for that nounce its unnecessary fuckery
no you then dont position "properly" you position for the drums and boom you changed half the game because of it, just dogshit take dude
because theyre retards that dont play their own game and have no clue whats even going on
in osrs sub devs actually talk with people and there is no flame
because they can be respected
osrs reddit sub is like 4 times bigger than wow sub at this point
and yet devs post regularly
its blizzards own problem they have no community management/interaction at all, they decide not to care, doesnt change that they could be more successful if they did
this isnt even from the osrs subreddit lmao
just fuck off if you dont know jack shit
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape
this is the actual sub
pathetic
yes
if at least they were a successful company overall it could be different, but $ATVI has been flat for the 4 years despite covid giving a huge boost to gaming, so I cant even buy their stock to make paying them feel less stupid, gaming has been popping off so hard that their stock being flat for so long is absolutely telling about how garbage they are, seeing how they handle classic makes me distrust them so much, they could invent the perfect cure for cancer and I still wouldnt trust them as a company
hardcore guilds are better at pushing people to log in and play the game, they basically do their job
what? $ATVI was at $63 exactly 4 years ago and now its $67, thats essentially flat lmao
1% yearly return for the last 4 years is fucking pathetic for a gaming company and nothing else
tell that to my 2000% return on NVDA lmao
I have been holding NVDA stock since 2016 and being told is a boomer move to hold stock for long XDDD
LOLOLOLOL
I bought NVDA at $60 pre split and it was up more than 300% before the pandemic hit, how much was NASDAQ 100 up for the same time frame? 100%?
nasdaq is the proper comparison for a company like NVDA
in 2017 it was literally the biggest % gain winner out of all companies in the S&P 500
and youre telling me it only took off with the pandemic
you compare stocks with the index they belong to, because just buying an ETF on the index is the alternative to buying individual stocks
if you want the concept of real estate to work for you but youre kinda poor, buy a REIT like $O and reinvest the monthly dividends
I dont invest in non productive assets, that doesnt even count as "investing" to me
5 dps?
if you are engi your loot council will think you are pro so youll get more loot = more dps boost
Are we just gonna be a *insert next expansion* waiting room until the very end and we then realize that we wasted all of our time waiting for that special something and it just never came? And we could have been playing better games or go outside and experience things for once during all that time? But then we're like 50 and shit at games and we ruined our bodies so we can't do much outside? Is this the destination of this train?
if youre just about goggles and wont use anything else, imo engi not worth at all
the goggles will be good for another 2 weeks or whatever and then you want t6 helm anyway
you kinda need your whole guild to use rocketboots or else you dont really have use cases where they contribute anything (other than the mother thing, but tiny gain)
youre simming wrong goggles then (or got another kind of error), the difference between goggles and t5 is 5 dps, the other goggles are from sunwell
pls tell me thornling can get solarian bomb
hes about to do a boweaving video :monkaS:
to actually answer the question, it should be 1/6
all I did was take it to meme lvl (and actually played it in raid)
it was refreshing to have to think of something new when spamming shadowbolt
Gem 🍊
Za one sims worse
No they barely need any
They skill most of it
Leave ZD to ele, boomkin, shadow for serving you well, unless the player is an absolute 🌰
On my server the rule of thumb was if you end up dying with less than 3 items you dont get loot, noone wore more than that either though
Fucking great, its 4 am and my cat brought a living mouse which is now hiding under the sofa
I exactly know that if I dont catch the mouse myself I will wake up to mouse organs and blood all over this place

Ignore the dirt
My cat is so dumb now shes just sitting there purring instead of going after the mouse
We have a trap but cant find it
Im locking the cat flap though, dumbass cat isnt leaving as long as mouse is here
Cat flap is locked and my bedroom door aswell, the rest is up to mother nature
!endgame
Warlock disc is still the best place for information about the class (has been since early classic at least), but the amount of kids spamming memes and copypasta in there gets a little annoying after a while.
there should be a command saying "just get the orange gem idiot" instead of that garbage that noone cares to read anyway
its almost as bad as the one saying loot prios are stupid
A command about epic gems should be saying that 
1) Red spellpower gems are the best simming gems in any gear for single target dps but they are fairly contested.
2) Orange gems (either SP/haste or SP/crit) - depending on gear - sim 0-1 dps worse than red gems on single target. They are less sought after by other classes than red or yellow gems.
3) Yellow haste gems, if they are in, could be considered for seeding gear, but given how contested they are it's not worth to get them just for seeding (unless you have a lot of gold).
4) Gemming orange SP/crit or (if available) spell/haste will be the best overall choice for most warlocks, not just for output but also in terms of availability.
in bis gear you only have 5 gem slots with free choice of gem so idk what youre trying to say, putting red in those 5 slots sims best in single target
I saw it twice this evening, just 30 min ago it popped the mouse trap but wasnt inside
as I wrote that I heard something ima check
its in the pantry, which sounds bad, but it seems like it wants to go outside
I just saw it again
as I walked outside the room it hushed back into the pantry
Ignoring the mouse trap..
Im using the kind of trap that wont kill or hurt it
I put cheese and chocolate into the trap

this is my cat that has lost interest in the mouse after bringing it inside..
well I take basic gemming logic for granted, its probably why Im bad at giving general advice, assuming too many brain cells on the recipient's side
Im gonna try to find some bacon or something to put into the mouse trap, it doesnt seem interested enough in cheese and chocolate
its going ham in the corner of the pantry rn, idk what its doing there, at least its not touching any food it seems, the mouse trap is equipped with ham now
I think Im just gonna lock the cat into the pantry and they shall have a deathmatch
What do I do if the mouse just decides to live in the pantry? This is not acceptable
my cat brought it here and it has been here for 22 hours, at this point Im not expecting the cat to fix the problem it caused
also the mouse is capable of leaving the pantry even when the door is closed, it can squeeze beneath the tiny gap between door and floor, Ive seen it myself, my cat cant do that, if I lock them both in there for a deathmatch the mouse will just leave and my cat will be stuck
have you ever caught a mouse with your hands? its impossible, its small and fast, the only way Ive caught mice before was with the mouse trap
no
I have trapped a mouse before and put it in a hard plastic box to keep it as a pet, it chewed through the box and escaped in less than a night
its a regular mouse
but I got the bacon for NYE to eat with my gf  :pepe_hands:
this is unfair, I have not chosen this fight and the mouse didnt either, I dont want the mouse to be here and the mouse doesn't seem too happy about being here either, after all it got carried here by the cat, but the cat isnt giving any fucks anymore about the mouse and when it does its incapable of catching the mouse again, this is pure malice
Im a pvper now
how do you deal with rogues on you in bgs?
Warlock disc is still the best place for information about the class (has been since early classic at least), but the amount of kids spamming memes and copypasta in there gets a little annoying after a while.
Ive locked the cat inside the pantry but at this point Im not sure anymore if the mouse is still inside the pantry
it could be anywhere really :monkaS:
its a bit paradox, I dont want the mouse to be inside the pantry because it could touch food which I dont want it to do, but at least knowing where it is gives me a peace of mind
though the fact that the cat isnt moaning yet due to being locked inside the pantry is a strong indicator that the mouse is still there
because the cat does what its genetics is telling it to do, it is mislead, also the cat has claws and resourcesresources, its the one catching mice because theres not much else that could be catching mice, I dont have shit not one paw not a single piece of cooked bacon yet I already caught three mice before, quote me on this before the year 2021 ends I am catching this mouse and I will not sleep until the deed is done, cats are nothing but one yuge bait. I'm already #1 mouse catcher in this neighborhood with way less to work with compared to other cat owners.
the cat just triggered the mouse trap because it got interested in the ham I placed there :pepe_ree:
yes
its not the kind of killing trap
the cat is lying next to me, purring as if life was good, meanwhile Im in horror
me?
it didnt kill the mouse though, the mouse is roaming around the house as if it was living here, I mean at this point I guess it is, but not with my consent
I dont get how the mouse doesnt even seem to be injured, the cat brought it here after all
just a couple months ago when I woke up and stepped out of the bedroom I was presented the entrails of not 1 but 2 mice, I know that it was 2 because I was able to identify 2 loose heads, and this mouse is allowed to just live here or what?
I am not going to kill a mouse
yes
The cat forgot that the mouse is even here
I dont know where it went it could be anywhere
the mouse trap was popped again when I woke up today, but maybe that was the cat again
no
this is not an infestation, the cat brought it here
I am fine with the mouse living here as long as it pays rent and doesnt do any of the negative things associated with mouse existence
The haste command is wrong because it contains statements that dont allign with the facts
Apart from being wrong it sounds way too confusing for people
Haste command should be this https://discord.com/channels/253210018697052162/823471727081422849/925764046010089493
!anyway
What is the haste command
!haste
Wrong
P1 when shadow was "weakest" I had 99.2 best perf avg and 96+ median, d e  l u s i o n a l
And I ran catabolt
Second paragraph w r o n g
Oh when daddy ryu brings up personal experience as an argument for fire then its ok but when I do it for shadow its "not a valid way of thinking"?
Thats what your warlock trainer just did which was the measage I responded to retards
He used his personal experience which is just that
Basically this discord baited all of dadguilds into fire and they would have literally done better day 1 running catabolt
Wrong
99.2 best perf 96+ median sounds pretty good for catabolt in a dadguild start p1
Playing catabolt would have been the best play for 99% of players start p1
So? Any guilds Ive joined afterwards have been licking my balls like its the holy grail because they found the best warlock to be ever seen
I got the guilds first vashj robes and it was only my 4th raid
1
1
1
1
But just because Im 1 on all doesnt mean Im taking all, giving ZD to our ele for example, which happens to be my gf, I can remote control my ele like noone else can, its advanced gameplay, my control reaches to everywhere it needs to for max dps. Totems not in range? I make her run to me and drop them. Just like that. Boom.
!endgame
!endgame
You dont avoid drama by giving in to idiots, you avoid drama by kicking them or not bringing them in the first place
I mean it kinda depends on the context, if someone passes on ToC in hopes of ZD but the weapon ends up going to a decent user of ToC, then thats a bit of a stupid move, but it doesnt hurt the raid, if it ends up with bad use/no use theyre braindead on a malicious level indiciating much further problems with this person/player
The 2nd best is still very good, not much worse and has other benefits, and a LC could balance it other ways, if you cant play for the team on this rather basic level in a team game, youre not made for the team game
Ive seen this kinda behaviour more from bad players than from good players, and teamplay is part of the game, if you're mechanically good but a shit teammate in a teamgame, that makes you a bad player of that game
I dont underetand the proposed system, people should be happy with either weapon option and stfu
I got T4 shoulders halfway through P2, before that they literally didnt drop a single time and I also didnt miss out on a single id (not even first one) rng can be such a bitch
pathetic
Im #1 dps at Magtheridon out of all dps on my server for p2.5 what u on about
Fire will not outpace arcane until sunwell and even then people are prolly gonna switch back to arcane as kill times plummet
Tbf I played the first 4 ids with a 8/10 guild and my new guild has a fair amount of griefers aswell (and no aff)
I could play in any guild I wanted but I play in a mediocre guild so I can play together with my gf who wouldnt be able to keep up in a hardcore guild, this is the reason im 98,9 and not 99
They need to quit that bs, JC necks are more dps per gold spent than most consumables
JC necks are like 5 times the dps per gold spent than destro pots yet so many are ignorant about them it drives me nuts, this is why I rather play with my ele gf which I can remote control than with slightly better but ignorant guild
And if the JC neck rotation between ele and boomkin breaks, I step in as a warlock no problem, its still a yuge gain for the group
And anyone w/o that mentality can piss out of my group
If they spend gold on anything with worse dps per gold spent than JC necks (which applies to almost all consumes), they might aswell be wearing JC necks, there is absolutely no excuse
Sounds like someone who doesnt understand his class and probably also gigantically sucks at ele in general, but because griefing the raid by popping fire ele on boss causes him to parse high every now and then he thinks hes hot shit, I am disgusted just by imagining this player, I could vomit but Im in a train right now so it would be weird and Im wearing a mask
In my first raid with my current guild I traded ele and boomkin the necks and just forced them to use it, I told raid lead Im quitting the guild if they dont use the free necks
5 minutes later we wiped at hydross because a hunter pulled aggro and they started mocking the necks even though they had nothing to do with it
Any player at any given time has to do what is best for the raid even if it means sacrifice of their own contribution, it just happens to be so that shamans are more affected by this principle more than others due to being a support class, Ive seen more than 1 resto shaman using useless ass healing stream totem in arcane mage group to "parse", making the group miss out on mana spring totem, classic players are so trash at this game its unbelievable, if you dont know how to interpret logs properly then your guild is better off not looking at them at all, Ive seen too many people whichs log analysys begins at "high number good" and also stops right there
My remote controlled ele uses fire ele on trash with my consent, not needing as much hit rating on trash makes it a move Im fine with
This makes it so that on boss they have cooldown on fire ele and cant "fatfinger" it
Since Ive basically mastered the things regarding warlock gameplay itself Ive branched out to being a support class puppet master, I try to ensure maximum support aura uptime by telling them where their totems or themselves are ideally positioned or in which order of mobs debuffs need to be up first, they dont think far enough for it by themselves so someone has to tell them, but as long as they execute my orders thats fine
Youll mostly get to hear "yes big diff" from oblivion users justifying their grind but trust me the difference is marginal at best. There are more effective ways to boost trash dps eg by boweaving
"Boweaving" is the terminus technicus for weaving Blade of Wizardry ("bowiz") in and out of your character's weapon slot during an encounter. Normally weapon swaps cause a global cooldown to occur, typically resulting in a loss of dps uptime if the weapon is swapped during combat. Thus it typically is inefficient to swap your weapon while you're intending to cast spells. This is not the case if the weapon swap is combined with the global cooldown of a spell eg life tap, shadowburn or soul shatter. Both actions can be performed at the same time. If you swap your weapon together with a spell that you would have used anyway, no loss of uptime can be attributed to the weapon swap. This means that you can start out fights wielding bowiz, wait for the proc to happen and then weave it out for a weapon with stronger stats, as a result - most of the time - skipping the majority of the 50 second inner cooldown that bowiz has. A successful performance of said actions is called a "boweave" and causes bowiz to be a much stronger weapon than it normally would be. After bowiz has come off the inner cooldown, another boweave can be performed for another proc. Jpaint kind of smells. The proc rate of bowiz is 15%, meaning that bowiz will proc at or before the 5th cast in more than 56% of cases. This causes boweaving to be a dps gain even in single target encounters. Here's an example. Warlock A: "How is warlock C dealing so much damage? I just can't keep up with him and I'm the one dooming!" Warlock B: "He's probably boweaving again..." Warlock A: "That must be it, I forgot that he's a master boweaver."
!endgame
Boweaving is not a meme, I mean it is a meme, kind of, but that doesnt change the fact that its the most optimal way to play a warlock
They see it as too much effort ig
No
Wrong
Wrong
Yes
For the start learning with life tap will do
I did the math and concluded that its worth, my math on boweaving is a public resource available in this channel, noone has made credible effort to contest it.
Horde is over hitcap too with toc, so whats the diff?
doesnt open up any tradeoffs, so irrelevant
only relevant w/o ele, or maybe specific sunwell gearing situations
being the creator of that gemming variant, I am aware of it
https://discord.com/channels/253210018697052162/823471727081422849/916418356138098759
Which this discord is giga shit at
okay
Your P2 bis list was wrong because you dont understand gemming
Ruby drape best single target simming cape in p2
lmao no
its not
why do you even talk, you dont share sim configs anyway
I was shared 1 config, I adapted the gemming and it showed ruby drape simming higher and that was that
share config
so what is your contribution then? you never share config, you just repeat things like a parrot w/o having an informed opinion that you can back up with facts
I havent been proven wrong on ruby drape, in fact I proved everyone else wrong and you shouldnt be talking when you arent doing any actual simming yourself, you went on for 3 hours on nethervoid not being the best simming cloak when otherwise wearing p2 gear which is so wrong, its like not even close, I provided sim configs, all you provided was talking out of your ass, I cant even call you a clown, because a clown is at least entertaining, you on the other hand are just sad
ruby drape being phase 2 single target bis is objectively right
I do think shownig sunstrider cape as an "example" in the guide was a poor move, you have 3 very close capes, at the point at which people are interested in the guide 90% will have at least one of the t4 capes, then you show them the worst out of the 3 capes which also happens to be bis for shadow priest, just asking for dadguild warlocks that cant read or think to grief sps
I was not wrong on ruby drape lol
if ruby drape wasnt bis then why are you wearing it 🤡
youre missing 0 items that affect hit rating
so I provide configs and proof, xelrog just talks out of his ass, and Im the one trolling? lmfao
show p2 bis config
@Ryusei you kinda hard to take serious, you run a spellhit ring and then you gem spell/spellcrit, if you were running kara exalted ring while gemming spell/spellhit, youd be simming 2 dps higher AND youd have more 1 crit rating, these are the kind of differences youre not seeing that make ruby drape phase 2 bis
you even admitted in our private convo that I was right about ruby drape and that I provided the necessary proof and now acting like it didnt happen 🤡
idfc about the way I look as long as Im right, if looking stupid is what it takes to enlighten people about the truths, Ill take that
the actual dumbdumbs are people like xelrog, making statements like "nethervoid not best simming cloak in p2 gear", w/o providing config or anything, and being giga blatantly wrong about it, yet insisting on the stance like a true clown, and then you have ryusei too petty to admit that nethervoid is the best simming cloak when wearing p2 gear while knowing that I was right (when you do the simulations, its not even close)
there is a finance and HEALTH channel and people discuss covid here 🤡
if you have some worthless clown like xelrog who just talks out of his ass trying to drown my objectively correct statements in his baseless bullshit, or you have a server admin that isnt even playing the game claiming "gemming is super easy, youre not contributing with providing gemming" while his warlock trainer has been corrected by me on gemming on multiple occasions and needed to have his eyes opened by me about ruby drape because he doesnt understand gemming/spellhit and is here and now wearing a straight up inferior setup compared to one with better gearing and gemming (with item he does own), then yes I will not let them portray me as the clown that I am not
youre right, you shits are not worth my input, so Im out
Leaving this toxic hellhole of a Discord has been the healthiest decision of my life. My sleep has improved, my thoughts are clearer than ever and I can smile again, at least every now and then. Even my ingame parses have rushed to new record highs, proving my theory that practical play and a balanced lifestyle lead to more performance gains than sweaty minmax theorycrafting. But you know what? I am not known for making healthy life decisions, so I have returned. I am charged with energy, full of real life mana, ready to force my semi-founded beliefs on any lost soul wandering to this place, using the power of esoteric conviction and memes. Buckle up and dust off the starboard because this place is about to get dank again.
Yes
I just followed my guild

socks kinda handy
but if youre gonna wear new ones the next day who cares
but I wanna nut more than once every two weeks
well this but unironcally, after leaving this discord my parses improved so that im now rank 36 allstar world for ssc/tk and rank 26 for gruul/mag, it was as if chains had fallen off, Ive left the discord because there was nothing new to learn it was just a pointless circlejerk, the products this channel produced caused dps increases on homeopathic levels at best, leaving the channel and focusing on things that actually matter was the more efficient play for this period of time, Ive returned because now that phase 3 is actually starting there might be new things to learn
well no, the philosophy behind playing catabolt since phase 1 day 1 has been that it produces the highest highs with the smallest requirements for execution, fuck being consistently average, I didnt come to play to be average, so Ill just hope for good RNG, many shadow enhancing debuffs no fire ones, mother is just what Ive already been doing on steriods
its just one out of 14 bosses, have you heard of supremus not liking fire type dmg?
its just 1 boss tho and catabolt will deal a lot more dmg overall than the opportunity cost for that boss is
most bosses are potentially entirely stationary if you simply decide not to move

if raid support was a consideration in this list then shadow priest wouldnt be D but more like S
they underrate anything that requires the slightest amount of skill, coh priest has the highest hps output ceiling by far but this boomer playerpool makes priest look worse than it is, similar to how nobody plays cat properly even though its surprisingly strong if played by a competent player, Id place priest just below shaman, if a genie would pop up and let me choose one of our healers and turn him into a competent player, assuming everyone to be equally bad, Id choose priest because it has the highest potential for making plays that actually make a difference
Wait they gave holy paladin a tank healing score of C?

unless being a god is cheesing then no
my guild doesnt even do chickens or anything and I havent had an aff for all of t5 except 2 raids or so
whats your problem with double lust, am I supposed to waste the extra lust or what
good setup has 2 extra lusts at least so warlocks getting 2 of them is standard
losers just jealous I get double lust all the time
if youre the king of the ring, the alpha among deltas, the big fish in the pond then of course you get double lust, asserting dominance my raid group is a part of being the best warlock I can be, its a part of the game
possible, but I havent seen it
yeah might be decaying in some pipe for all I know, the cat probably injured it when she brought it
nethervoid cloak is the best simming cloak out of all p3 cloaks when otherwise wearing p2 gear
this guy doesnt know swp items
this game is already swp waiting room, idk what would have been so hard about buffing boss hp by 40% or something, also 75 second boss kill times could end up make us look bad next to classes with higher peak dps
@Ryusei jealous?
technically yes
well its a fun story, the SP we had was supposed to be hunter but he failed to loot vashj quest item the day before so his hunter wasnt attuned, and since his shadow wasnt main char... and the shadow we wanted to bring randomly jumped ship a day before
Hannu in shambles
oh wait nobody uses this sheet
Anyone else enchanted their precious nethervoid cloak with shadow res and intend on keeping it that way? Lets be real 2% threat is not gonna make a difference, either you have to soul shatter or you dont have to
for the first kill I have a setup that doesnt need crafted gear, also have rocket boots
I think some ids down the line the kill speed will be very quick and you will have to be extremely unlucky to get ported twice, so long term I guess my play will be to wear rocket boots and nothing else, if I get ported rocket boots + shadow prot pot + nightmare seed, if I do get ported twice I guess Im fucked
but honestly if you get ported twice your parse will be fucked anyway regardless of dying or not
well I am anyway, catabolt since day 1
Im oom after 57 seconds of bossfight and this was without having any haste items, catabolt scales with haste because haste makes you oom faster

bloody non catabolter (= noob) Gasgas catabolter
science bitch
Your average bossfight will have you casting 50 shadow bolts which means catabolt saves you 1050 mana these fights now if you gonna tell me thats not gonna make a difference you should apply for 🤡 school but not as a student but as the president
very reasonble take, havent looked at catabolt from that perspective yet, Im convinced now
Look at this joke of a content who gives a fuck which classes get which item you could have a warrior whacking bosses with zhardoom and they would still die so why are you being so special about it, this whole game mode is just about boomers pushing their ego enabled by lack of challenging content, only guilds to be taken serious are legit speedrunning guilds and dadguilds that are realistic about their badness and go for a pleasant social raid experience, everyone else is mostly just participating in a sorry ass clown fiesta
This game is mostly about fake world fake pixels and real time wasted, so its beyond me how blizzard went through with dead on arrival T6, in T5 a 10/10 week one clear was unironically somewhat of a respectable achievement and now just about anyone can be 14/14 week one, how am I supposed to feel superior compared to all the wageslaving boomers on my server now? This is unacceptable, I demand content hard enough to make me feel better about my otherwise derailed life
Its not my hobby
I wrote this as Im cooking
Its just a side thing
Pasta
I put shadow res on mine, 2% threat is never gonna make a difference, either you have to soul shatter or you dont and 2% threat is not gonna make a significant impact
I got nethervoid cloak yesterday, at first I was delighted but then loot council mentioned that they count it as a "bis" item in their LC sheet, they said theyre aware that its not technically bis but that realistically they are never gonna give council cloak to a warlock so nethervoid counts as bis for us, when I picked up the item I thought I was being a good raid member by not minding to pick up an "upgrade" but what I actually ended up doing is lowering my chances on items that actually matter, meanwhile the other warlocks are picking up nethervoid in trash farm runs, @Ryusei Im trapped in my own meme utopia, Im wearing nethervoid and Im not liking it
trying to explain "ISB crit support" couldnt change the LC's mind unfortunately, but Im happy with nethervoid still, its a 23 spell upgrade from ruby cape which is just as much as much of a difference as taking buff food is and whenever Im missing food I feel bad, so I should feel good about wearing nethervoid
after all at this very point in time I'm wearing the best simming p3 cloak for my otherwise p2 setup
cata saves you 21 mana each shadow bolt, your average p3 bossfight will have you casting about 50 shadowbolts so thats a 1050 mana gain which is almost 2/3 of a life tap, so its gonna make a difference more often than not hard to argue against these number tbh
catabolt does scale with haste and it also scales with not using immolate which anti scales with haste
wtf those are a steal
new warlock in the guild just told me in convo that he thinks cataclysm is criminally underrated
instant best buddy
soul leech does deal a decent amount of damage aswell
if healers have to heal you less then they can spend more time dealing damage aswell
which boosts raid dps which boosts personal dps
its not literal whatever, your average t6 fight will have you casting about 50 shadow bolts each which is 1050 mana and most of these fights are stationary, so in most ids you probably save 2-3 life taps on bossfights thanks to cataclysm which Id call significant due to lack of cost of opportunity
nah not my only buddy
its just innocent and healthy play between buddies, its required for growing strong, its an aspect of being the most efficient warlocks we can be, we keep it on a semi-real level otherwise it doesnt work

meh using immolate is just like adding bonds to your portfolio of stocks in case of a market crash, it will make you feel "safe" for bad times but its also holding you back from achieving anything significant, does warren buffett buy bonds? no, so why are you casting immolate?
Id agree if that comment was about something like cloak slot, but youre literally fucked until the end of the expansion if you dont get skull
you are
you dont have enough spellhit rating in swp without skull you need to make additional compromises then it really starts hurting beyond the active effect
you have 164 spellhit rating in best in slow swp gear which is including skull
are you pre-coping for not getting skull or what? it will undeniably screw your whole gearing situation in swp because you need the spellhit rating to use other items efficiently
the drop rate of skull is 1/6, guess how many fangs of leviathan our guild had in all of p2? 0. literally zero. guess what the drop rate of skull is? also 1/6. ZD is a replacable item with a reasonable alterantive existing now (ToC) and better items existing in the future, skull is not replaceable, its elemental, Im not taking any chances on skull, fuck that
its 1050 less mana spent in a fight with 50 shadowbolts, so Im pretty sure cata will on average result in about 3 lifetaps on bossfight saved per id lockout, at the same time you have higher highs due to SB only, it shouldnt even be a debate at this point, idk how anyone can still be casting immo, maybe tiny peepee? idk
ZD is only like 10 dps better than ToC which also exists here and now and is less contested

you need to have a healthy amount of diverse views otherwise its pointless, you cannot make progress without friction, try getting your car to move when its standing on ice, doesnt work, the wheels spin and that would be this discord if everyone was blindly following the cult, add some intellectual contrarians and you have a nice grippy ground for the discord to move on, sure sometimes your tires run hot or you hit a piece of broken glass along the way, maybe you run over an innocent noob that just joined here and there, but at least youre moving and not standing still spinning your cult wheels
I respectfully disagree and propose my dissenting opinion to this theory. Even opinions without merit have value and add to discussion, they get you to double and triple check your believes and after that strengthen your conviction. Look at moon landing conspiracy theories. Do they have merit? Not really. But they got everyone to carefully observe the matter, conspiracy theories regarding the moon landing were clinically debunked and now everyone left questioning the moon landing is a legit clown. Before that maybe not too many questioned the moon landing, but if you asked the average Joe their level of conviction regarding the moon landing it probably wasnt that high and it was easy to lure people into believing the conspiracy theory. Now everyone is precisely informed. You may say that conspiracy theories like that waste everyones time and if they didnt exist there wouldnt be need to build conviction for the obvious, but my counterpoint to that is that they actually arent always wrong or at least sometimes contain some elements of truth. For example this discord was very set on cataclysm being a useless talent and saying it was worth it was considered an opinion without or with little merit. You were treated as a conspiracy theorist if you put points in this talent or at least considered to do so. In this case though they ended up being right and the general consensus shifted towards cataclysm being a talent worth spending points on. The vast majority of such opinions that don't seem to have merit end up being wrong, for example Mayo ended up getting banned from the discord not agreeing with gemming orange spell/spellcrit being optimal for raiddmg due to isb uptime support. While it was very obvious that he was wrong it did raise attention to this matter and more warlocks gemming orange with stronger conviction to do so exist now.
well the point stands regardless if they got banned or not
raising awareness about value of gemming orange while not having an opinion with merit
the warlock that could have contested skull got banned for 2 weeks for gold buying right before release 🙃
Literally none of the highly upvoted suggestions ever ended up being realized, they dont even give a response as to why its not being done, you could be living in north korea and send a letter to Kim making a constructive suggestions and at least there youd get a hanging as a response, here you get nothing
In the long run (15+ years) anything above 10% average annual returns is unrealistic or requires you to be on a skill level like warren buffett is, but until youve built capital of decent size its not worthwhile to go that deep, time is spent more efficiently by improving income, people that make bank in crypto, nft or anything the like should take that money and run because the inherent risks involved to make such returns will sooner or later turn against them if they keep doing it

honestly this wow classic community is one of the shittiest gaming communities Ive experienced in all of gaming, and yes I have played league of legends, and at least when someone in a game of league is asking me to kill myself, I know that they care about the game, meanwhile so many are halfassing WoW classic that its beyond me as to why someone can choose to play the game that way, they pay a monthly fee to blizzard to play the game, then they pay goldfarmers so they dont have to play the game outside of raiding and then when they do go raiding they put up a pathetic show, I honestly have no idea how it can even get more clown than that, why play the game if youre not actually playing the game?

wrong, if the healer has to heal you less that means the healer can go deal dmg instead which increases raid dps which increases your personal dps, so soul leech in fact deals more than 0 dmg
Ive seen this kinda behaviour more from bad players than from good players, and teamplay is part of the game, if you're mechanically good but a shit teammate in a teamgame, that makes you a bad player of that game
this was just a copy paste from weeks ago, so neither was it effort to post it nor was it optimized for mayo's case, yet the kid is roasted, just like that
you nerds would gain more dps by taking care of your mental health and body eg by going outside for once rather than by malding over theoretical gains that will be overshadowed by your practical incompetence anyway
I mean he is providing friction at least to some degree, but its more like instead of the wheels spinning on ice theyre spinning in shit
I congratulate you, from my rear mirror
isnt it highly dependant on boss kill time rather than person gear?
There is no proper tuning for a player base that reaches from calibers like Gasgas to boomers that cant play more than one mechanic at once to save their lives (if even that), thats why they introduced different modes, Blizzard, assuming they even care at all, will just tend to serving the larger part of the playerbase which happens to be boomers, if you want to recreate that feeling of "progression" in this older content then you will only get disappointed, until we get to the harder raids some expansions down the line by that time you'll be a boomer yourself, this whole endeavor is doomed for anyone capable at playing the game, its like when you are on a long car ride with your parents and they just wont listen to you asking to stop each time you're passing a McDonald's, you suck it up because at least you're driving to Disney Land but then after that long ass ride it turns out you're not going to Disney Land but to boring auntie Martha, Disney Land was just a bait from your parents to make you come along, as you're being forced to eat auntie Martha's broccoli soup you're thinking of all the things you could have been doing instead of joining in on this ride like playing on the N64 at Jordan's place or at least doing your homework for once, this ride is what WoW classic is and with TBC we just passed the second McDonald's.
Well but nobody is quitting the game, you have sunk cost fallacy and also you'd feel bad for your raid team if you and the items they gave you left, so  you're telling yourself that you're quitting at the end of the expansion but thats exactly the moment the next big juicy yellow McDonald's M starts to appear on the horizon making you feel hopeful and excited

When I first played Gothic 3 I was too stupid to understand what is a bug and what is just me being bad at the game or not knowing how things work, so I just ended up having a blast and enjoying the game
Well there is indeed some context to be added to the vacation I took. Partly it was because there was nothing for me to learn from the Discord at that point in time and it was mostly just driving me crazy. But also a famous Austrian singer called Falco - this happens to be my homecountry - once said "In Vienna you first have to die in order for them to celebrate you." Falco used to be a very controversial personality, he had a very arrogant attitude and was very open about his cocaine consumption which at the time was uncalled for. Ironically he did die at very young age and only after that he was universally celebrated in Austria. With my vacation which ended up being perceived as my death not only did I regain my sanity but also I took a note out of my fellow Austrian's playbook. My appearance seems to be much more appreciated now and my views have been widely adopted. If only Falco, after leaving, had a 'join this Discord" button too...
If you wear shadow res to be "prepared" that means you're less likely to have the dps required for the skip, show some balls and fully commit to the plan.
Going for a healthy 30-60 minute walk before each raid will make a lot more difference conpared to having a "strategy" with seeding. Imagine everyone in the raid does this, different game.
If having gone for a walk before the raid makes you cancel one less shadow bolt for no reason you're already in the money in terms of efficient time usage. Even a 10 minute walk could do that, each step is literally a step towards the right direction. You'd also die less, use your cooldowns better, have less casting gaps and generally be faster with everything. The raid will as a result also feel more enjoyable for yourself which some say is even the point of the whole game. Now if also you take a shower after that walk and prepare yourself a jug of black tea to drink during the raid you're golden. Also make sure you eat something before the raid but not too much. Imagine you pull through with this habit every single raid, you'll turn into a machine of execution, your mind will be so present that you're basically time travelling into the future compared to everyone else in the raid. Think of the cost of opportunity which is not having farmed chipped power cores or maybe not understanding in depth why cataclysm is a strong talent - those things are irrelevant in comparison to the performance gains of physical activity, shower and black tea before each raid. The tea will result in your bladder about to explode during the raid but thats why you also bring a bucket for the pee and incense sticks for the pee's stench. This is not just efficient for each raid individually but also scales with time as you stay fit while others degenerate. They may mock you now for not being a "understander of haste" but when MoP releases we'll see whose laughing last when they turned into rusty relaxos while you're still a mighty machamp. PS: while going for your walk before the raid think of the motions to go through each boss and what to watch out for
Thats what I tell the girls too
One more thing: Clean your rear mirror regularly so you can still see and laugh at the crashing fire warlocks behind you in the distance. Laughing also has a positive effect on your mental capabilities.
When creating your character have you noticed how all of the classes look exactly the same even though they're suoposed to be very different? They're not that different when naked at all. Your character is a blank canvas and it's your decicion what you paint on that canvas and if what you want to paint is a healthy, humble and happy little warlock that also happens to be a top tier dps player then it's absolutely possible for you to do so.
If instead of buying gold each time you want to buy gold you put that money into a company's stock you can buy the whole gold farm 50 years down the line.

I died right after the prisons broke, 0 bops from paladins or anything, I was about to parse 100 it was so sad, I still parsed a 95 despite missing out the entirety of the last phase, still world rank 5 so not too mad tho
ironman btw
Isnt doom dmg sticky making what this warlock performed here kinda pretty dumb?
Did he do the big dumb or just dumb?
But that raid he was dooming while I was applying cor so not only did he perform the dooming suboptimally, he also caused a cost of opportunity by claiming doom for himself instead of letting someone do it who would have performed it optimally, which would have been me
But now if always being on cor duty makes him unhappy at playing the game resulting in him playing worse, causing even higher cost of opportunity than him dooming suboptimally does?
But we're in phase 3 of the expansion, the fact that he has not bumped into this fact of correct dooming indicates hes also making unwarranted errors unrelated to dooming, to me it seems more like his whole TBC career is doomed and we should find a better warlock rather than just swapping curse assignments
I think the way it works is that most pumpy pump fights are sub 2 minutes anyway, so it doesnt really matter when you doom or when you pop a 2 minute cooldown, you will have only one of each anyway, so at the start of the fight you start casting shadow bolts without any buffs active, this makes it so that the tank has some more room to build aggro, you wait with dooming until flameshadow proc is active and then you pop icon + bloody fury + destruction potion + chipped power core resulting in the ultimate doom of all dooms all while not having cost of opportunity compared to popping cooldowns early
armor scrolls are criminally underrated they bump you from 1500 armor to 1800 which is very significant gain % wise (Im bad at math so I cant tell you the exact % increase but I bet its high) and they only cost 50 silver or something at least on my server, so they increase your chances to survive at basically no cost while also reducing the incoming damage from typically non life threatening physical debuffs like bleeds, this means you having applied an armor scroll results in less healing required which means healers can spend more time dpsing resulting in higher raid damage resulting in more personal dps for you
Are your healers not dpsing whenever they have the opportunity to do so? Where I come from they call that
fire warlocks trying to impress their crush with their wcl profile
(casting immolate while otherwise using shadow bolt still makes you a fire warlock)
technically yes but most people will be too overwhelmed with trying to pay attention to the aura so while they may correctly cast immolate when they are supposed to they get caught offguard by a fatal attraction port so they screw up and die, this on average means more dps loss than playing the boss "correctly" by casting immolate, also since this is just 2 minutes of raidtime in which you would consider casting immolate out of 3 hours of raidtime its not worth assigning an effective hotkey for the immolate spell making the whole deal with being overwhelmed by things even more likely, also then you have cost of opportunity for the hotkey you decide to put immolate on, this hotkey could be used for something more impactful like armor scrolls

you know what I think its fine to not be oneshotting everything and have some "ok now I saw the boss"-wipes, but wiping to akama is just sad

definitely intending to run skull+quag, only problem I see is that if quag pops early together with everything else up, the tank threat might actually be an issue, at least with our tanks, and icon would stretch the generated threat a bit more

takes key item and leaves, nice guild member
nah, not if youve built the necessary level of RESPECT
well yes and it was very forgiving for t4 and t5, but imo t6 it can make quite the diff, people talk about skull and weapons but the biggest difference would be if you get hardstuck 3/4 on the setbonus, sure the pumping play will be the same but it will feel less rewarding
for anyone not willing to sim these things themselves the answer "t6 shoulders look cooler" should do

Be prepared to get assraped single target by rogues (even w/o chicken) in the near future. From now on we exist primarily because we are a simple weapon, we are just like Russian tanks, easy to produce, easy to maintain and effective enough, that makes us efficient for the war, but we wont be as shiny as others may be.
Guild immediately gave me 4 hearts for the bracers because I'm the biggest pumper in all of german speaking world of warcraft. But because I'm also a savvy participator in the stock market I immediately sold the hearts on the auction house for 550 gold each. I'm intending to buy the hearts back from the auction house just before next raid and for much cheaper. For the less informed: This is called a "short sale".
but Im obliged to buy them back before next raid so its ok I dont see the downside, Im the one taking the risk not the guild
:monkaS:
Im on a pumper server now
yes
3 weeks in I already own this place
yup
sounds like the perfect excuse, plausible and kinda funny :thonk:
been doing this in pserver since 2013 lmao
Ive done it 3 times since our original guild disbanded Im now in a "regular" classic guild with most lacking that experience
this vid even proves it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK98KtBUrn8
yes
next reset
you can see very clearly here the absolute joke of a tuning we got here, in the vid they have 1.75m hp each, here they have 1.075m hp and on that server black temple wasnt specifically tuned they just took a different state or something
you get away with way too many errors of execution with the hp they set for t6, had they slammed 50% on top of everything it would still have been very doable but you would have had to actually play the mechanics to some degree
on pserver skipping demon phase wasnt a thing until everyone had sunwell gear (at which point barely anyone entered black temple), and I reiterate it wasnt tuned, they just took a non clown state of the game
its basic logic that this tuning is WRONG, illidan makes it obvious, design decisions were made for illidan demon phase, being able to just skip it wasnt the idea of the creator or at least certainly not doing so in the first id even by mediocre guilds
based on the logic of "not cheesing bosses with stupid things" they got rid of most world buffs that you could drag into raids, it was also a conscious design decision, now they dont even have the balls to kill the chicken or to adjust boss hp to what is actually reasonable and makes an enjoyable and worthwhile game, they "defend" it with some stupid mental gymnastics like "reacreation of the game" or whatever, an aspect completely ignored for other changes like boosted characters or "improved" graphics, they are only getting away with it because 80% of the playerbase are listless and flaccid BOOMERS that have trouble playing a 15 year old game properly, we are here clowning ourselves with "theorycrafting" for completely pointless content, content that is here to stay for another 6 months at least, t6 was literally and I literally mean literally DOA, the only consequential thing to do would be to either quit the game or declare war on the boomers but instead of doing one those things here we are still clowning ourselves with irrelevant item and talent tree discussions
its fun until boss kill times go down to 60 seconds making it an absolute critluck fiesta
always that stupid fucking chicken
if I was a melee Id already have quit the game just because of the chicken
I click tear from inventory works fine
you just place it in the top left slot or something
my stupid guild actually told people to get some week aura making pressing tear "boomer proof" and what happened? I clicked tear from inventory no problem while some dude died to fall damage because the weak aura wasnt "working"
if you need a weak aura to use tear just uninstall or resort to role playing in cities
I believe there are different ones but if you just practice using the tear 2 times at the cliff you completely fine not using a timer
yes binding is fine too, if you actually think telling 25 people to rely on an unnecessary weak aura that will make the raid wipe if it doesnt work/theyre to stupid to implement/understand it, then honestly youre the worst at raidleading boomers
if players cant press a stupid item, bench them, WA is just another layer of possible failure added, pure stupid

I mean I am using wa for other stuff, but not for pressing a fucking item

You have to understand though that warlocks arent the end all either. We primarily exist in raids because we are a simple weapon, we are just like Russian tanks, easy to produce, easy to maintain and effective enough, that makes us efficient for the war, but we wont be as shiny as others may be.

but its probably a good idea to open an account and invest a small sum anyway just to have gone through the process and started the account, otherwise will probably just forget
basically everyone got a 100 at archi rn
it would be of half decent difficulty if they didnt choose this pathetic state of t6
true
its with not many pixels because you have to zoom in from so far away
tanking kael is a gain
speedrunning and parsing are the only things you can do in this game, there are no other reasons to play it unless you play it in a super social way and give actually no fucks about what happens in the raid
anything else is just clown
would end up with tanks griefing the raid by wearing too little def gear
there would have to be a "total value contributed" score that also factors in support shit, but its probably too complicated
I dont find myself griefing the raid by "parsing" though, its more of a bad player problem, people who struggle to get 90+
its just a complete joke that they didnt just fucking remove the chicken the second they noticed it, it takes a combined 3 brain cells to see that that would be the best for the game
I dont mind playing 1 button class, you have a lot more room to pay attention to little things that also end up making a difference
they only use that this type of arguing when it suits them, they changed a crapton compared to the original game, just so stupid to make this argument
also then everyone had shitty pcs and no knowledge of the game, why is it not accounted for?
idfc what people did back then or what they did not do, just make a decent game here and now, dont care about the past
im fine with these things existing on a level like chipped power core but anything going too far beyond that is stupid
there are more boomer guilds not 14/14 than youd think and the rest will delude themselves into thinking "I need to farm t6 for sunwell which will be challenging again"
ready to pump tomorrow
Can we have the pathetic meme as a reaction? @Dive
Boomer mages exist that end up below pumper warlocks
Which is pathetic
What is this waste of screen space as I scroll up the chat? Just get rocket boots and shut up
Also this person doesnt understand movement speed breakpoints
The chains break at intervals if you dont hit the breakpoint of breaking them one interval sooner with the 8% enchant then it did nothing and the res enchant would have been more optimal
Even if you run back faster to the boss, that doesnt mean you'll be casting an extra shadow bolt, the difference is so minor, thats why its called "minor movement speed"
With rocket boots you hit those movement speed breakpoints
You could also get an extra bolt using the vitality enchant
If you dont get ported at all its always more value
Also this heals you for FA
Vitality enchant generally overlooked and underrated
Generally, and this is especially true for t6 because here most fights are stationary, the value of movement speed correlates negatively with the level of boomerism in your guild, the more boomer your guild is the less likely you are to bottleneck the guild's progression within the raid due to a lack of movement speed. Some guilds are so boomer that you could be playing the whole raid with the hamstring debuff and you wouldn't be holding them back.
Parsing 99 is the baseline, if you're an advanced warlock gamer you don't ask yourself "How could I parse 99 more often?" you ask yourself "What plays and decisions have the highest highs so I have the best odds of parsing a 100 every once in a while?" If this way of thinking works out against you then you still end up parsing 99 because of how good you are
holy shit you were right fucking end me
ss yourself
Can the flames in p2 be tanked with a warlock wearing fire res or what is this warlock tank thing some are talking about?
???
1 lust each phase
lust in p2 is fine you just need to know how to handle it
nightmare seed, along with armor scrolls, has always been criminally underrated by the incompetent plebs making the majority of the playerpool
kinda depends, one extra lust should be placed in the melee group in phase 1 because then it has like 0 armor
this is very efficient for killing the boss quickly also increasing your personal dps even if not lusted due to shorter kill time from the melee lust phase 1
your average raid with a decent raid comp (not super minmax with class stacking but reasonably tryhard) should have 2 extra lusts, so one goes to melees phase 1 (rogue can have 4k+ dps spike here due to 0 armor) and the other one warlocks phase 2, warlocks phase 1 could also be a consideration but you have to keep in mind that phase 1 can be very short with lusted melees so you could end up having overlust (means you waste some seconds of lust because enemy is dead, similar to overhealing)
well not "rest" in P3, BL everyone in P3
extra lust the second one swapping the pleb not listed
bonus content for phase 2: demand earth shield from resto shaman, use nightmare seed if concerned about surviving
also in general have scroll of armor applied on yourself always, it increases your chances at hitting the armor breakpoint of surviving 1 hit when pulling aggro and it reduces the periodic damage from some stuff like bleed effects
there are quite some bosses where you can experience spell pushback at least to some degree so it may be an option to demand the resto shaman to have earth shield applied to you permanently, then its harder for them to screw up, but you can also set up weakauras for earth shield demand, for example the resto shaman would have a big red text pop up when you press a hotkey saying "Gasgas demands your earth shield NOW"
well I mean anything thats physical like I think gurtogg stacks deal less dmg then
?
and warlocks have exactly nothing to do with the one you were talking about
you got schooled, please sit down
armor reduces physical damage, if it doesnt its a bug
if you drive too far away you lose sight of the enemy, also you spend too many resources than maybe necessary and you might lack them later on, its a common tactic in racing, you build a comfortable lead but you manage that lead in a resource saving manner while also keeping track of what the guy behind you is doing, this way you will have more gas in the tank if they show any sign of catching up, which is unlikely for this discord but theoretically possible so its the optimal play

Its bis even in wotlk
oranges in legs depends which wep you get
full red in chest should always work
oh yes
if you didnt trash farm exaltet the night t6 was released then Id call that
Do I spend the majority of my gold on red gems for vestments?
A lot
T6 better
from my observations theres not really a scenario where 3x red gem into vashj robe isnt the ideal play or am I missing something? dont wanna waste 2k gold
the shaman healer yoinked the only 3 reds we got because leadership handles gems "first come first serve" and he asked first
I really dislike how when you sort for overall damage it still shows the average boss parse, stupid boss parse culture
no its just stupid
bosses are just larger trash mobs
they mean nothing they shouldnt wipe anyone
the valuation is just very off
5 seconds more or less boss kill time dont do shit for the overall raid
who cares about 1 button rotation when you get this
haste gems not being in kinda increased the value of anything containing haste
dont need world buffs to feel powerful when playing a shadow destro chadlock that is about to be stacked with items from t6
world buffs was cancer havent been missing it for a single second
Boweaving is chad, not more to say
Dont try to fight the cult, its not even an uphill battle, more like an upwall battle and theyre throwing things down on you
U know what playing with bowiz is more fun and thats all I need to know when PLAYING a game, which I happen to do for fun
checked an old pserver video of myself for mother hp.. 4.55m hp vs 3.2m here, basically all bosses 50% more hp, same for trash, and no this was no hardtuned pserver, was advertized as "blizzlike", what we got here is such a lame ass joke, its like not only did we not stop at the mcdonald's, we got taken on a detour so we wouldnt even see it, if logs didnt exist for virtual cock measuring nobody would be playing this "game"
undertuned content is toxic its similar to worldbuffs, when you wipe in this content you know its out of sheer stupidity and/or incapability, just annoying, wiping to respectable content feels less bad
if you want to recreate the experience you cant just take old boss hp values and act like everything else doesnt exist (reliable connection, 1000 FPS, max information)
I think its not w/e it makes everything very meaningless
sunwell is just another fake mcdonald's
by the end of t4 raids already reached the raiddps required to kill brutallus
so idk how its supposed to be interesting
im not going through this shit again
idk whats so hard about slamming some hp on top of bosses and mobs and calling it non boomer mode
slamming HP on top of things has a big effect for small effort
you actually run into problems if people keep misplaying the boss mechanics, have shit raid dps, healers running oom and stuff
untrue and false
yes
the moment fights are suddenly longer not only playing boss mechanics correctly is more important but also you run into the phenomenon of healers actually running oom, so you have to adjust for that and also take less unnecessary dmg, healing then turns into an actual resource people care about which right now nobody does
everything deals more dps in shorter fights, arcane mages being the extreme example of course
try gurtogg with double hp
retail has other issues, the fix to this content is so damn easy yet theyre not doing it so its absolutely justified to complain, I can absolutely see myself unsubbing 2-3 months into t6, MAYBE coming back for wotlk but who knows maybe by then Im playing a more fun mmo so I forgot about wow? you cant just shit on game quality forever
increasing boss hp and calling it non boomer mode is not spending resources, they probably spent more resources on making their game woke-compliant, many pservers had tuned content and many worked on those unpaid from their basement fueled only by passion
if it was just for nostalgia trip they should have 1 month intervals for phase releases
exactly this is what makes things interesting and meaningful
people be saying "but thats how it worked back then too" - so what? it was bad game design and theres no reason not to fix it except ignorance, similar to how theyre not introducing dual spec despite TBC being predestined for it, if we had dual spec Id be playing pvp also
idk if I would still be playing if I wasnt playing with my gf who the content is suited for
its her first time playing wow and shes playing from a laptop, so actually playing similarly compared to people back then
(read laptop as shitty hardware)
shes playing ele so its very optimal for me ensuring that I get most of that support
Since Ive basically mastered the things regarding warlock gameplay itself Ive branched out to being a support class puppet master, I try to ensure maximum support aura uptime by telling them where their totems or themselves are ideally positioned or in which order of mobs debuffs need to be up first, they dont think far enough for it by themselves so someone has to tell them, but as long as they execute my orders thats fine
in the grand scheme of competitive gaming 95 parsers are probably still pretty shit at gaming in general
they just have good results here because of pathetic player pool
my guild isnt seriously pushing times and Im stuck in this guild because I want to play with my gf, so what am I supposed to do to find a challenge other than trying to parse (without griefing the raid doing so which Im not)?
also many guilds seriously pushing times require shit like playing multiple characters for loot funneling raids which isnt my type of thing either
I did give retail a fair chance in summer and while I did enjoy mythic dungeons, more interesting class rotation and raid mechanics the other aspects of the game were just too negative to keep playing, to me tbc is literally the better game all things considered, just the lack of real challenge sucks
Im very perfectionist about things in general, the first time I didnt fill my vault I was tilted and quit, there were too many rat race systems in place or in general unnecessary systems, and fuck having to do torghast weekly
I was already considering quitting paying for 1 char
ofc, horde bis raiddps = bis personal dps, also orc
Ive simmed server choices and venoxis came out of top, largest german speaking player pool by far, most skilled player pool also because good players know that a larger player pool means more better players so its a self fulfilling prophecy kind of thing, so you have better recruitment opportunities meaning more raiddps meaning more personal dps
also boomers avoid high pop balanced pvp servers because they have no time for getting ganked
thats probably the biggest bonus anyway
on venoxis he cant be the king among fools
Austrian
but thats the same basically
I mean it is
historically
south tyrol should go back to austria unironically
also having Trieste back would be kinda neat
all of Tyrol should belong to Austria but in reality there should just be 1 big alps state then we could get rid of lower Austria and Vienna
youd be 8 in prog on venoxis
5th
but tbh even if youre 5th in prog, you still took 6.5 hours ending after 6:30 am which just means you had enough workless people on your hand not exactly skilled people
ok boomer
Im just teaching him the ways of realism, Im not saying my guild is even remotely good and we definitely have too many boomers to pull off something like that, but at the end of the day we didnt take any longer, so all they kinda did was clowning themselves into thinking a progress ranking past 6 am was an achievement that goes beyond the legwork of staying up
it was enough to be meaningful on Großdrachenrufer and thats fine and all but its nothing special on a real server and Großdrachenrufer is dead now so might aswell move on instead of looking for the next Großdrachenrufer
if I was looking for a new guild the clear speed ranking is what would matter to me
caring about speed doesnt mean being into speedrunning
I would rather look at other aspects I literally couldnt care less about progress on this piss easy content, first id needs to be clear thats all
What is left anyway? ZA and Sunwell will be dismantled by raids with T6 gear, who cares if that happens at 3 am or at reasonable times, its not a question, the game is over, you can do speedrunning, you can do parsing, you can jerk off to pixels, thats all
you can speedrun any game or have an equivalent to parsing implemented, the origin of that "fun" does not lie in the game itself, and jerking off to pixels is kinda pathetic, that means the game is over, officially, and the rest is self entertainment
if your guild isnt pushing for clear time its all you have left
the last straw of sanity
the last bit of meaning
I quit
void
because all of you rank greedy bastards went to get some other colour Im standing out with green at this point
well before that you had ryu so whats the diff
now people hold what you say to higher scrutiny and theyll start nitpicking on stupid shit
#1 in progress on Großdrachenrufer was the meaning he had left for playing the game
now its being taken
the community could be anything, you think its special, well its nothing special, it just feels special to you but in reality its nothing special, its a trick from your brain, every server has a community more or less, your brain can delude you into thinking the community on a 100 pop faction was special, well its not and it would have *felt* the same with any set of 100 people, you can also embrace the feeling a large server gives you and call that a community, youre just falling for social nostalgia, youre about to leave a mcdonald's that has always been a mirage in the first place
it gives them money if people otherwise cancel sub
a lot of people just keep playing because theyre a established part of a guild but when presented with an opportunity to quit without social implications many will, when our guild from private server disbanded only like 20% kept playing
there are many things they could have been doing that are low input high output, like dual spec or having at least half existing communication with the playerbase
the playerbase is only getting older if they dont make a quality product that also draws in new players the game is literally dying, Im convinced investing in the game quality at least to some degree would have been a positive move from a business perspective
they should have just copied the oldschool runescape approach the blueprint was literally there it would have been a positive business move but they decided to go full publicly traded company retard
increasing revenue from games has become all about the question how can you squeeze thousands of dollars out of whales monthly
microtransactions dont only have the potential to create a lot more revenue than subs, they also can make people keep paying the sub due to sunk cost fallacy
I casually play a mobile game and theres absolutely no point getting the premium currency unless youre willing to spend literally hundreds of euros, 10 euros will get you nowhere, its made for whales only, it actually makes it feel kinda less pay2win because the kind of person that will spend hundreds of euros on a mobile game is usually also bad at the game
You can just claim layer 5 on Venoxis with your community
They dont change a thing unless it gets 75+% in the poll so its kinda idiot proof only the better stuff makes it
Some potentially good stuff like sailing doesnt make it but thats the price you pay
They could have made a poll on dual spec in WoW
Or doing casual pvp pvp specced
Does that crowd even exist anymore or did they all die due to old age
Ive heard tales of them but not found one myself
No its decent and very stable just also very boomer
If you know the guild Inspired that guild I lead in classic
They are a lot more casual since I gave it up but its nice to see them still existing
Either you think T6 looks clown or you think it looks beast, I think it looks beast but its always like that, items with good stats automatically look good to me, its kinda similar with how some girls will start finding ugly men attractive if they have a lot money
Not owning up to your logs is pathetic tho
going hiking in the mountains now
any healthy warlock pumpers in the chat?
Well not yet since we're just starting
Its with my ele gf for warlock group synergy
in any guild that is to be taken seriously rhonin just shouldnt count as an item and its irrelevant context for anything else dropping
@Healspls No, not being garbage at the game is not cheese
its 10% crit but ok
the guy is overwhelmed by participating in jc neck rotation what do you expect
This guy's deck is CRAZY!” ☑ “My deck can't win against a deck like that” ☑ "He NEEDED precisely those two cards to win" ☑ “He topdecked the only card that could beat me” ☑ "He had the perfect cards" ☑ “There was nothing I could do” ☑ “I played that perfectly”
imagine getting a free trans out of your hellhole and not using it on venoxis
just leave them
if your guild was to transfer to venoxis they are replaced within 5 min
why again are you in this guild?
ok, sure, you going to some deadass server when you can go to venoxis for free is like going to community college just because your crush is already studying there when your parents would have sent you to yale
youre griefing your own future for retards
cope
noone guarantees you that
you got a free ride in disney land and went to the fucking pony carousel instead of the big thunder rollercoaster
cope
delusion
now youre at the pony carousel waiting in line for another 4 months along with other degens while everyone else is already having fun at big thunder
noone needs server discord unless youre desperately trying to recruit, otherwise its sperg only zone
recruitment happens on classic.warcraftlogs.com server discords are just for hyenas picking up the leftovers from the lions
this is what you should be getting w/o 4p t6 https://discord.com/channels/253210018697052162/823471727081422849/939172970591584287
having atiesh implies having played classic unironically so its a strong indicator for pathetic player
have you checked the rank youre using? in my previous guild I saw a warlock use rank 10 shadow bolt in p2 and he only changed it because I found out for him
is someone about to have a "OH SHIT" moment?
sounds like being mediocre with extra steps
damn I didnt know they have like almost 100 rides/attractions https://disneyland.disney.go.com/attractions/
its what Im being told to believe
I did hyjal trash farm to exaltet and have seen a total of 8 nethervoids so far (mainraid + trash farms combined)
so kinda pathetic not to own it at this point

Ill let you know when I have mine for 2nd enchant
why ruin every healers day when youre in a social guild?
big question
Why the fuck does Hildis sim not include restore mana prime enchant on chest when its clearly the bis enchant for chest? It restores 144 mana in a 2 minute fight, its gonna allow you to cast another shadowbolt often enough for it to be worth compared to the 3 dps gain that is 6 stats on chest.
@Kristofer include restore mana prime chest enchant in sim or im cutting funding
there was an attempt https://discord.com/channels/253210018697052162/823471727081422849/939671159060983848
but combine bigger starboard breakpoint with less active users, now its just another mcdonald's we're not stopping at
well I would but everyone adopted my views so theres nothing to get upset about 🤷
except @Kristofer who isnt including restore mana prime in the sim, I think its hidden bis
spellhit enchant is never a solution
even hit gems most of the time arent a solution and their spellhit to spell ratio is 5:6, with the spellhit enchant youre looking at 3:4, its garbo
this is not what anyone is talking about
spellhit enchant is never an efficient solution
gems barely ever
because more efficient solutions exist
efficient items like ruby drape/nethervoid, when you make use of the spellhit rating they have they tend to be stronger than anything else but you have to see case by case
I would like to try it for single target
@Kristofer the 6 stats chest enchant represents a 3 dps upgrade compared to having no enchant according to sim and it doesnt get any stronger from longer fight length, more so that it gets a tiny bit weaker because mana pool is less relevant in longer fights, and restore mana prime restores a whole (cataclym) shadow bolt in 5.5 minutes, but after simming that mana spring totem is only a 17 dps increase in a 4 to 5 minute long fight Im kind of sure restore mana prime isnt worth it, because thats 50 mp5 resulting in 2.9 mp5 needed for 1 dps increase, so at best restore mana prime is a bit more than a 2 dps upgrade, which is a smaller number than 3 is
guys have I been gemming my vestments wrongly all along?
i sburn whenever its the optimal thing to do dps wise and I run 2 soul bags (usually just filling those isnt enough)
At least it wasnt "buddy"
Now everybody repeat in chorus
Trust what the sim says
Ryusei said "sim yourself and you will be enlightened". And it was good.
one simulation a day keeps the green parses away
In the name of the Zephan and of the jpaint and of the holy Hildi
Amen.
resisting the temptations of irritating commands is the trying path to light we all have to walk
it depends
in darkness there can be light, and in light there can be darkness
only the sim can show us the way
I got nethervoid first id alliance camp
Mayhem, stop spewing bullshit, at least towards the guys that have an actual inquiry. 
You want to troll me and most people here? Fine, go for it. But when someone has a legit question you either answer properly or shut up
my prayers have been heard
the nethervoid was given to me
redemption is far from you my son
I'm sorry, this is the way
99% of ontopic discussion is just the same shit over and over
interesting and engaging discussion is a mconald's we haven't been stopping at for a while
I'm not swapping w/o isb stacks already up
You enchant shadow res on normal cloak
Less Kaz mana burn less azgalor silence less other bullshit
immediately assuming im having mother in mind just because shadow res is in play, very clown, 2% threat reduction doesnt do shit, either you run into aggro problems during lust dps peak and you have to shatter or you dont and 2% less threat isnt gonna change that, meanwhile shadow res has the potential to increase dps at some bosses and in general improve survivability
already happened
ive been running it since ramparts
always been comfy
I got it today
apart from that Im a high roll philosopher
Mayhem, stop spewing bullshit, at least towards the guys that have an actual inquiry. 
You want to troll me and most people here? Fine, go for it. But when someone has a legit question you either answer properly or shut up
You have to understand though that warlocks arent the end all either. We primarily exist in raids because we are a simple weapon, we are just like Russian tanks, easy to produce, easy to maintain and effective enough, that makes us efficient for the war, but we wont be as shiny as others may be.
I got T6 shoulders but it wasnt really an upgrade, it was more of a sidegrade, it adds consistency due to lack of proc but not really much of a dps upgrade on average according to sim, not very satisfying, T4 bonus just too stronk, they will complete my set as fast as stuff drops so hoping for luck with tokens next id
not having the drive to squeeze out 2 extra hours as a one off event kinda indicates it though, if you dont have the drive for that, youre probably also a potato in other areas
its like the only thing Ive said today? apart from that its true
the difference in performance of single players in "top tier" guilds is way too big given the low skill ceiling of the game, just that difference existing alone is a strong indicator for many shit players even in those guilds and @jpaint before you @ me again google the definition of "indicator"
this guy coping cos he cant even parse in 35 year old game while standing still
just do it like this
what? this works always and is the most efficient thing to do anyway
yes but that doesnt matter its still the efficient move + you get CLEAN timeline always and not these ugly gaps, probably that alone makes up for the wasted crit
since I often get double lusted I can see myself just starting with agony in those common sub 2 minute fights and pop cooldowns after it went through
you also have to look at your ass in a mirror to notice that you forgot to wipe it yet you wipe it always, I assume at least
knowing that youre not gonna put it to work its kinda like when the school goes to visit a prison and you get to have a look at the bad guys at the other side of the fence, youre that buffed dude flexing his muscles getting laughed at by kids fully knowing that you cant actually hurt anyone, the cocky chad of the class shows you the finger while the teacher explains how dropping out of school will have you end up like jpaint
the whole point of theorycrafting is to get results and heres theorycrafters telling you results dont matter 🤡
imo the cringe starts precisely at the point where split raids are a thing making half of the raids not even that fun + having to have characters for loot funnelling purposes only, like if you care about being competitive to a degree where it becomes such a grind might aswell play retail or a game thats actually made for competitive gaming, I guarantee you most players in speedrunning guilds would be stuck in low to mid elo in actual esports-titles, the level of gameplay in classic wow is just that low
its not an assumption its a fact, if youre sub 30 years old youre a youngster in this game and player skill starts degrading at like age of 20
Tetris speedrunners 😂😂😂
From 20+ its an uphill battle, 30+ its over
Why do you think the best advice I have for players is staying healthy, its literally the most efficient you can do for this game because most other efforts are less efficient due to 80/20 rule
I mean I can see tetris speedrunners being insane but it means nothing for the general statement, even my osu! gameplay would look insane to the common people and its not very good relative to other players
I will give you the real talk ok? I hope you are ready. A main driver for why people play MMOs like WoW is  achievement and recognition substitution, the male part of society is especcially guilty of this. Nobody likes you at school, you get bullied even by teachers and girls avoid you? Well in MMOs you have the chance to be the chad of the class for once, you're in the best guild of the server and other players cant even get close to the gear you're showing off to them in Shatt. Suddenly people respect you, for the first time in your life you get to build self confidence and you have friends. All while, unlike in real life, you have fairly equal starting conditions, your ugly looks dont matter, your alcohol abusing parents dont matter, your embarrassing auntie Martha doesnt matter. All that matters is you and your dedication to the game, that reliably feeds back validation, recognition and respect. Now back then you got that out of weraing gear from hardest raids and dungeons or even being max level was something to be "proud" of, but the things that once yielded such respect no longer do so and clearing raids is no longer an achievement. Nowadays everyone has those things, the ego printer stopped working at that level, playing the game like you used to isnt enough, so you have to move on to the next level. This is what high end speedrunning and "progressing" WoW Classic is. The bandaid fix to your broken real life success substitution printer, you keep feeding it with your time and often even money, to stay on top, to keep the chemicals in your brain forming, to keep alive the Potemkin village youve built for your life's success. Thats what you're doing if you take this game too seriously.
Its ok, happy printing Mr. "warlock trainer"
I just got back from grocery shopping for me and my girlfriend, which was a productive real life activity. All you are doing by playing this game is creating virtual 1s and 0s on hardware far away and out of your control. It doesnt matter how "good" or how "bad" you are "performing" at the game, it's just 1s and 0s in different orders, they're the same. The provider of this game can delete your 1s and 0s at any time and you have no power to stop that, not physically and not even legally if they stop accepting your money for them to have you create 1s and 0s. You have tricked yourself into attributing value to the 1s and 0s and their order, but they offer no real life physical benefit. They don't feed you, they don't provide shelter and they don't help you reproduce. You're sinking time, effort and energy into the order of 1s and 0s. That's all you're doing. Think about it.
If you think this is by any means "normal" just because other people are doing it aswell, you are mislead. You are part of the first generation of human beings that even gets to do this. 7500 generations of human beings have lived before you, they survived against sabertooth attacks, sat out extreme weather conditions in caves, built houses, cities, infrastructures, dedicated their lives to technical and scientific progress and lost their lives in wars for a better future. Each generation lived to build a better future and got your generation to do the things it is doing today, you playing this game is the result of 7500 human generations sweating it off in real life before you. How are you thanking the previous generations for their hard work, what are you doing to make the life of the next generation even better? Nothing. You are playing a virtual game with no actual product coming from that activity other than certain chemicals temporarily forming in your brain. You're sinking your energy into things like "dps uptime", "optimal cooldown usage" and "efficient gearing" while resting on what 7500 generations of human beings have built for you. You're doing nothing for the next generation, you're not even working on producing the next generation. You're just shamelessly wasting all of it. Imagine your grand-grand-grand-dad being resurrected, getting to see you. Imagine this man that just risked his life in a riot for a glimpse of democracy standing behing you, seeing you play this game, seeing you perform proudly what you call "boweaving". Imagine that. Imagine it like I say it, imagine it with the same power of imagination your grand-grand-grand-dad has fought for your democracy. Now go to a mirror, look at yourself, ask yourself: "Is this really my calling? Is this what I am meant to do as a human being? Is this worth the work of 7500 human generations?" Personally, I'd say yes, but that's up to you. Think about it.
Did Jesus have any selfish reasons to come down to the plebs, to try to enlighten them, just to become a target and die? No. He healed the sight of the blind for them to see just like I am here opening your eyes about your real world fake pixels producing temporary chemicals only.

its doesnt matter in what type of guild you are, 2% threat reduction isnt gonna allow you to hit a threat reduction breakpoint, either you have to soul shatter or you dont and 2% more or less threat isnt gonna change that
shadow resistance
so what
you can resist azgalor silence, kazrogal mana drain, generally have less incoming shadow damage which t6 has plenty of
If you're riding just below tank threat one fat crit can grief the raid, you have to shatter either way
shadow resistance enchant on cloak lets you
- take less damage from death & decay at winter chill (= you can finish your cast calmly before moving = more casts)
- potentially resist anetheron sleep (= more shadow bolts when not sleeped for 10 seconds)
- potentially resist kazrogal mana drain (= less taps needed = more shadow bolts)
- potentially resist azgalor silence (= casting more shadow bolts)
- take less damage from archimonde curse 
- help you survive your own shadow bolts from ros p2
- take less damage from aura of anger in ros p3
- more chances to survive at mother
- probably other shit I forgot to mention

2% threat enchant does
- realistically nothing
how is it a shit posts I listed cases of shadow resistance dealing damage
I bet the 8 shadow resistance enchant on chest on average deals more damage than 6 stats in this content
stay mad stay bad
3/5 shitty abilities you want to resist just in hyjal
and youre not running it
LOL
this is me resisting azgalor silence which Im more likely to due to shadow res on cloak, so I get to have more uptime on my casts and theres people claiming 2% threat reduction deals more dps when aggro isnt an issue at this boss anyway due to the silences 🤡
on Kaz I resisted the 2nd mark
not running shadow res on cloak is 🤡
I would assume no
it can proc from the mark

but you still get the mana burnt
since the spell is already applied
so theres antheron sleep, kaz mark, azgalor silence, ros p2 selfdmg and p3 aura dmg, mother survivability
in sum thats a lot of value extra shadow resistance gives you
the rest doesnt give you jack shit in reality
for general purpose shadow res on cloak is the best enchant
later when you have more nethervoid cloaks I guess you can have multiple with different enchants and swap
also shadow resistance lowers the amount of damage taken from dark and demonic runes
I wasnt able to find evidence for it, I used 10 dark runes last raid and didnt gain nether protection from it, if dark runes were able to proc nether protection you could take one just before the mark comes in, then youd have a chance of the buff existing on you before you get hit by the mark, I wonder if some gimmick-items exist that lets you proc nether protection on purpose
it can be fire too
Depends on the place, university campus in Vienna? Very accepting. Pub on the countryside? Not so much. But its not like someones going to shoot you, they will just drop a stupid comment and talk shit behind your back
@Dive mod me bitch
You have to understand that warlocks arent the end all. We primarily exist in raids because we are a simple weapon, we are just like Russian tanks, easy to produce, easy to maintain and effective enough, that makes us efficient for the war, but we wont be as shiny as others may be.
bois I finally got skull
when going ToC Id try to go waistwrap and when going ZD Id try to go noose
generally underrated and haste gems not being it kind of made it a tad more valuable than it already was
Any P1 players?
Magtheridon is awesome, everyone has to work together and you get to deal extra damages
my guildmate is #1 affli P1 content
we are a P1 focused raiding guild
last gruul raid we had 2 afflis, dont ask why
Magtheridon hard boss + bad loot = true test to a guild's cohesion
Illidan easy boss + good loot = not a test at all
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/9LTkHnC1MNdbyPDa/#fight=9&type=damage-done
3k dps ezpz
53% is nice but not like "insane", 40% is average rn
Im gonna need a rear mirror for my rear mirror
yes
yes
other lock in our raid got 100 on anetheron tonight
I was suprised 3150 was enough
didnt even require THAT much critluck
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/venoxis/gasgas
I dont cast immo
akama hardest boss this content
I was parsing 99s phase 1 too lol
because the raid ended 2h ago or so
no idk it does this every raid with not locked in
it locks in some hours later when the allstar ranking is updated or so
who the fuck gives a shit about kara lol
just because I happen to have gotten some 99s doesnt mean I was actively going for any
we were splitting raids in ways that made sense for loot mostly
well I very successfully proved a point
t6 items offer a fair amount of crit on their own
I absolutely love how ridiculous the hp pool gets with t6, Im already at 12.5k raidbuffed, maybe ill go for ZD just to sit at 13k+ like a boss
on top of that you have healers loving to heal you because of 20%
very hard to take down
you dont searing pain finish
you deathcoil finish
imagine needing coil for survivability with 13k health pool
on council yesterday I took 24.1k damage in total and healed myself for 13.2k, I literally would have survived that boss fight without receiving a single heal, 9.1k of that was soul leech, yet people exist that shittalk this talent, you cant make up that level of 🤡
that healing I dont need is a recource that can be transferred into raid dps which also helps my personal dps
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Mhvn42VycW6xagqY#fight=70&type=healing
so what? it was 9.1k healing
99.9999% of your fucking emberstorm talent is useless
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Mhvn42VycW6xagqY#fight=45&type=healing&source=26&phase=3
0.34% OF IT WAS USELESS OH MY GOD MAYHEM SO STUPID TALENT
IF 3 WARLOCKS HAVE THIS TALENT ITS ONLY 75K HEALING HOW IS IT ANY VALUABLE
if anything I can see the argument for going 3/3 soul leech rather than 3/3 backlash
3/3 soul leech is like infinitely stronger than 2/3
and in t6 there arent really situations where u can get use out of backlash
thats fun and all but 3/3 soul leech would actually heal a crapton, obviously I realize missing 1% crit wouldnt be worth it

im watching my mana closely and stuff and actually there are SO MANY situation where I can just barely squeeze out a shadowbolt just because of cata
im going to tell you
3/3 soul leech is best in slot talents for m'uru
if anything was actually hard the value unleashed by 3/3 soul leech would be massive
when you stand there facing entropius youll be dealing 3.5k dps and that will translate into 315 hps with 3/3 soul leech which is 23,625 healing over 75 seconds which is VERY SIGNIFICANT for that fight AND WORTH MORE THAN 1% CRIT
that is a fight you specifically respec for
at least in progress
fucking clown
if you actually knew a single bit about that fight youd see that respeccing 3/3 soul leech for it is worth
I can see that its probably not gonna be necessary for the better guild
many not so good guilds with warlocks exist that should do it though
mages have either holy pala or prot pala existing in their group with concentration aura on
and you dont
what you do is put all earth shields on warlock
restos have pala and just assuming if the fight ends up being hard, they need mana from manashield anyway
if this was possible Id instantly do it
so much value
not paying 50 gold for that shit it does literally nothing either way
wrath is coming
look, I get the whole idea behind "searing pain finishing", but in the end youre just making it more complicated than it needs to be and you end up doing things like this
it deals so little damage, if you misjudge just every 5th time or so you could have gotten out another 10k shadow bolt crit
"intentionally"
I put the first thing I found
alwasy these baseless accusations
people should record their BT raid, watch afterwards and count the amount of times cata did make a difference, it occurs a lot more often than youd think, it was a secret the cult was trying to hide from you, it worked in T5 just as well too
reducing variance is a downside not an upside
unless something goes terribly wrong Im parsing 99 anyway, so Id rather increase variance to maybe parse a 100 every now and then like my warlock bro did on anetheron last raid
the brain power youre using for considering to use searing pain or not or immolate causes too big cost of opportunity for it to be worth, you could be thinking of more significant things like your wife's boyfriend instead
I knew the endgame of warlock all along and I also knew that any steps before that are absolutely not worth the effort put in, you all just wasted your time, the logs prove it
people recently been talking about "10k club" and shit, bitch youve still been clowning yourself with fire when I joined that club in the 2nd id of P2
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/ALz7vJ4FkCVmab8Q#type=damage-done&source=7&fight=76
look this guild disbanded after the 3rd id of failing to clear the content
that was the reasoning actually xd
this is when you join 11k club
yeah sure lol 
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/venoxis/gasgas
ill have to get a bigger rear mirror once the allstar rankings update
very clown guild
adds ran through killed half the raid and we only barely killed akama, I was praying we wipe
we know just boomers letting adds go rampage
obvlivion is garbo
Either you play this game competitively or full out casual, anything else is clown
I can take dadguilds rping in raids more seriously than jpaint
Jpaint is not a 🤡  hes the 🎪  director
wrong
moving and losing uptime are 2 different things
our mages already both got slippers pretty hyped about them already being open for warlock
can go take ros boots
boomkin and ele should be pointed towards ros boots and not receive slippers unless nobody else needs them
going channeled elements is griefing everyone else
you can still get vestments so get them
if you activate rocket boots just before air burst do you just shoot up to the moon?
dont need any of that for 3k
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/8MLHTcdBravCtmbn#fight=9&type=damage-done
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/8MLHTcdBravCtmbn#fight=18&type=damage-done
which pathetic raid comp doesnt have extra lusts?
im going naxx tomorrow and I made my gf join and put prio on motc to have double the chance
40% is the standard, anything below is unlucky
"Adam, I have to tell you something."
"What is it, Jenny my dear?"
"The doctor said I've got cancer, I can't believe I was so unlucky to get cancer at the age of 22 😿 "
"Jenny, it's fine, you're not unlucky, that's just how statistics work."
How can you be so heartless, Adam 😿
t6 helm?
use orange spell/spellcrit
my gear is epic gems only no rare ones left
I bought the red ones from ah
hehe congratz man 🙂 it is an amazing helm indeed and you alwas feel mighty when the wings come
I dont see the problem, price of purple and orange are like "ok" and the chance is high that ill be wearing BoB every now and then even if I get another belt
btw when you do those ZA runs, chances are you dont have an ele
still feels awful resisting often and I dont wanna feel awful
Billy, there are more efficient ways to get some hit than that trinket nowadays
any daily quest parsers in the chat?

I am sadly not actually a big nerd like most here
my raid loves giving me items thats much more fun than paying for them



wtf is this matrjoshka type of quest, I thought I was gonna get candies after handing out 15 gifts already
this pasta hits too real
People still super bad at Archi or anywhere really, all fights are too short for it to matter
No I played on soft tunes pserver with just +60% in BT and that felt like what it should actually be

actually on thursday I resisted kazrogal's mark resulting in 2 taps saved which is like more than 1 shadow bolt
when you have to shatter its in the first 30 sec or so of the bossfight and 2% threat reduction isnt gonna change shit about you having to shatter or not
I have to shatter when I go on a crit streak early on with lust and everything active, and quags often too
"Boweaving" is the terminus technicus for weaving Blade of Wizardry ("bowiz") in and out of your character's weapon slot during an encounter. Normally weapon swaps cause a global cooldown to occur, typically resulting in a loss of dps uptime if the weapon is swapped during combat. Thus it typically is inefficient to swap your weapon while you're intending to cast spells. This is not the case if the weapon swap is combined with the global cooldown of a spell eg life tap, shadowburn or soul shatter. Both actions can be performed at the same time. If you swap your weapon together with a spell that you would have used anyway, no loss of uptime can be attributed to the weapon swap. This means that you can start out fights wielding bowiz, wait for the proc to happen and then weave it out for a weapon with stronger stats, as a result - most of the time - skipping the majority of the 50 second inner cooldown that bowiz has. A successful performance of said actions is called a "boweave" and causes bowiz to be a much stronger weapon than it normally would be. After bowiz has come off the inner cooldown, another boweave can be performed for another proc. Jpaint kind of smells. The proc rate of bowiz is 15%, meaning that bowiz will proc at or before the 5th cast in more than 56% of cases. This causes boweaving to be a dps gain even in single target encounters. Here's an example. Warlock A: "How is warlock C dealing so much damage? I just can't keep up with him and I'm the one dooming!" Warlock B: "He's probably boweaving again..." Warlock A: "That must be it, I forgot that he's a master boweaver."
great, ill keep that in mind while staring at the thing lying in my inventory because I forgot to put it on again
yes its fun and effective
you get so much power
the only problem with boweaving right now is aggro
things get very wild when you get quags + bowiz proc early on in a bossfight
while youre still wearing t4 weapon, if you picked up skull or 4p t6, boweaving in that case is a lot stronger than it was before
FUCK YES
there was a 4th one too
I use destro because its more fun
Fuck what sims say
I believe destro pot has higher highs than mana pot
if you have destro pot active with quags proc and you get a lot of crits
its kinda like
its a drug basically
you get that adrenaline going
like really you feel it
no
thats not feelscrafting
I am thinking of it objectively now
but in the moment you know
im definitely a feelsplayer
I think a mana pot towards the end of the fight isnt gonna make or break the performance
youre just averaging chances kind of
but if you crit a lot into your destro pot with other procs and quags eye
Im very sure that deals more damage
its a higher high
giving me a bigger chance at parsing a 100
which is basically all I care about
I didnt come to play for average results
last raid the other warlock in my raid parsed a 100 on anetheron
now the pressure is on
I cant just go and waste my opportunities with half flaccid dick mana pots
when he parsed that 100 on anetheron he used a destruction potion
the warlock right next to me in the raid
in order to beat him I have to become him
I got slept at anetheron
no pretty even the raid overall
I flexed on winterchill just not 100
world rank 5 still
I tried to macro slammer and sb and it didnt work
ty
other than that im not going to waste a single milisecond of uptime for something that can be solved by luck
you see he wasnt using slammer either
you can do what you want
if you want a 100 you have to be a lucky bitch mostly
I havent seen him gather any candies yet so that might be my advantage for next raid though
I have 4p t6, he has skull
game is on
considering I still have mageblade but 4p t6 ill boweave on bosses next raid it should be worth
very certain its a gain on average
and it causes higher highs
Noone can tell the actual value of speed on boots enchant, its worthless on most fights
Vitality enchant on boots could have you save a tap
arent you afraid of hitting the buff limit with all that stuff on?
so in most fights in T6 movement doesnt matter like AT ALL, vitality on boots restores 4 mp5 which is 96 mana in a 2 minute fight and theres a real chance that that saves you one tap in a bossfight every now and then, for many bosses you know for certain youre not gonna move or if you do move you do it while on tap gcd anyway so it doesnt really matter how fast you move, moving 8% faster doesnt do anything if youre gonna arrive at your destination within the gcd anyway, meaning boars speed isnt allowing you to hit any movementspeed breakpoints, so for those fight having vitality enchant is bis and can absolutely save you a tap which is huge if it does happen
WHO NEEDS MOVEMENT SPEED IF YOU DONT MOVE
I never said to get vitality enchant if you only have 1 pair of boots which you use for everything
but theres a very real chance someone has 2x shifting nightmare or something
and it would be absolutely reasonable to bring both with different enchants
wait
no
nonono
theres something better
the ideal play for the bosses anetheron, kazrogal, azgalor is to have 8 shadow resist enchant on boots
Generally, and this is especially true for t6 because here most fights are stationary, the value of movement speed correlates negatively with the level of boomerism in your guild, the more boomer your guild is the less likely you are to bottleneck the guild's progression within the raid due to a lack of movement speed. Some guilds are so boomer that you could be playing the whole raid with the hamstring debuff and you wouldn't be holding them back.
but you just said what if the guild doesnt clear in 1 night
that to me is a dogshit guild
Im not saying its a bad guild because the quality of a guild is mostly determined by what it wants to be and not all guilds are about sweaty raids, but it is a dogshit guilds if it doesnt do that
theres a difference between judging a guild based on being a guild and judging their performance when their goal is to have good raids, if theres a guild with the primary focus on having weird sexual RP in the last corner of undercity and thats what they do, Im not going to say its a bad guild just because they arent clearing raids, its not my type of guild but if talking about guild quality it may aswell be the best guild in all of wow, nobody knows, absolutely possible
sb spamming is the way but if you link your logs I can maybe point out whats missing for 99s (may be setup related tho)
Its not me who changed, its this discord that changed and adopted most of my views, theres barely anything controversial left, youre not throwing any balls at me to swing back, you came to stand next to me and also swing what gets thrown in my direction
Its just that Ive been winning so much that maybe youre getting tired of all the winning
depends on how you gem other things
you have 2 items in which you go purple+orange one of those can be t6 shoulders you cant really go wrong with it unless you already got noose and slippers gemmed that way
vestments you go 3x red
wbuffs way more 🤡
youre also getting worse and worse as you age
good luck parsing in shadowlands classic
20+ uphill battle
30+ its all ogre
resultcraft is the only way of crafting to take seriously, I dont care what is theoretically the best, or what feels best, I want fucking results man
I have rank 13 world log on council so shut the fuck up, tell your priest to get his shit together and swap to the mage
this whole "spell pen for council" shit has gone way too far, biggest clown discussion seen since cringers shilling illidan cloak
I broke 3k dps on winterchill without 4p t6 or anything remarkable from p3
I was rank 5 world the first lockout with 0 items
whats the last remarkable thing you last did? shit without having to wipe?
sorry
im removing the clowns
youre not a clown
youre the fucking circus director
but he made the point that I have items while others dont?
me leaving the discord because of you would be like a lion stopping his hunt just because he stepped on an ant and it felt itchy for a second
quote me on this the top parse on council by the end of the phase will not be some 🤡 wearing spellpen
you watch too much lion king with your mum
lol what?
sorry that my raid is capable of identifying who the boss is
the first one wasnt even part of the 1st id lmao, also he got these vestments the 2nd id of p3 and got najentus dagger because he was too lazy to farm a p4 level weapon, the second one got haste ring and skull
sorry that my raid has the brain cells to process the concept of rushing 4p
the guy is a slug so whats the problem? also hes the 2nd to get 4p
even though he missed out the first id because he was banned for buying gold
trying to judge loot distrubition off of logs while missing 100% of the context is even more cringe than the spellpen thing
ill call people slugs if they are and even if its the pope idc
the guy was using thrallmar weapon up until he got dagger last raid
and then he got himself banned for buying gold and that way missed out on progress
are you gonna tell me thats not a slug?
we farmed gruul all the time and whenever mageblade dropped he wasnt in the raid because not 100% attendance
he didnt farm all kara raid
he could have been wearing bowiz and it would have literally been better on its own
and ur calling me out for saying hes a slug publicly while he objectively is?
🎪
because hes the circus director
he stole jpaint's job
the guy is a slacker
he just doesnt put in the effort
hes fine but hes not giving it all
hes the least I will accept
the guy got vestments, najentus dagger, nethervoid and t6 legs within 2 ids while having himself banned for the first one, wtf is your problem
oh and t6 hands too
@Healspls I would have skull on top of everything aswell, I mostly didnt get skull because I wrote in the RCL note to give it to the other warlock, when was the last time you did a selfless act like passing on skull, when you gave free entry to your circus on labor day?
quote me on this in 3 months from now spellpen on council will commonly be seen as the meme that it factually already is
be careful you are about to be determined a selfish loot funnelled persona non grata
when I was 9 I made a small lake of coke for the ant colony to drink and they all kinda just went there and died
imagine not having all quests done in prep for wotlk achievements
nobody that has any say in this discord is even playing the game
its like how in ever 2nd country the sports minister is some fat dude
eots and arathi are bis because you can be certain it will be over within 15 min or so
why do mods have orange colour when theyre all blue parsers
in my old guild there was a guy who produced a three coloured turd, he was so proud he took a picture and showed the whole guild, it became a common meme in the guild
I would not put these things in my fridge
I believe theres a website for uploading and rating turds
theres nothing wrong with observing your shit it can be an indicator for diseases and shit
yes
we have such a toilet
im in austria though
what was previously in his ass is now a part of you
if bael is from vienna hes not austrian anyway
the shit can serve as a ramp for the water coming down causing the splashing water go beyond of where its supposed to go
link logs and ill point out what will cause you to have better results
where link
Hes from Vienna, Austria's only city that could breed this kind
Heals is cringe about gear, none of the shit I wear is contested long term, while what others in my raid got is, he feels guilty when hes wearing more than necessary to cover his tiny peepee
Last council I took so little damage that soul leech alone would have kept me alive, kiting is for dogs
The top strategy will be allowing for casters to also optimally dps (as in not gimping output with spellpen), top raids have no issue with dealing with the casts the mage casts
You know the kind of people that will judge million dollar football coaches  even though they've never kicked a football themselves? That's Heals taking some diehard stance on top end council parsing while his guild takes 5 attempts to even kill the boss
Its ad factum
How did I have inflated crit rng lmao
You dont even know the average lmfao
I crit 40% on average, thats a normal result
I had 38,9% on council and 39.8% for all 14 bosses, you played yourself kid
I know its pathetic, had he done it correctly, would have been 100 parse
He doesnt have to do much, you just focus the mage and swap only when bop up, thats how the boss is played, nothing else
No he just fucked it up, with proper debuffs would have been a 100, he will do better next time
You realize you're just proving my point? I got world 13 despite getting hardgriefed
2 sets (1 pala) for 3 ids is absolutely normal, sorry your guild was out of luck, didnt possess the brain cells necessary for rushing 4p for sets and/or didnt choose you to be the one even though you're in warlock discord permanently
I got rank 5 winterchill without any of that lol
If anything the loot is holding me back due to aggro issues arising
See how he remembers small little details from ages ago? Worse than your average gf
My mate who just copycats me got a 100 on Anetheron without any tier, 3150 dps, but no its the 4p enabling it all 😂
Mostly its not about warlock but directing others to do whats good for you or at least ends up not griefing you, for example there are a few bosses in T6 for which you need to demand earth shield as a warlock, I bet most of you arent doing that even though its the optimal play for you and the raid, yet you go here and say only crit% matters
Earth shield healing is overrated by cringe heal parsers they've been shilling it for that purpose, but that power belongs to warlocks, absorb all of the power you can and destroy
My earth shield shaman happily gives me earth shield though, its an honor for him to be the one to do it, it makes him feel like a part of my success (even though in reality hes just a tool)
the same as every day
Pussy and this Discord's lunch
54% crit is lucky but not insane lvl of lucky and usually not enough for a 100
I'll let you play my char even
You can farm my soul shards while I shag heals mom
And I still parsed 99 with full sleep
Goml
I had no crits that fight anyway
And the other dude no slammers either
The T6 helm was the last piece of my 4p and that big surge of power made me realize something, it was that moment when I first flexed those wings onto my raidgroup while landing a 11k crit that I ascended to comprehend the ultimate way of warlock understanding, the most optimal way to play and behave is exactly what the warlock class fantasy is, absorb as much power as you can and dont ask for it, demand it, because you deserve it and you are worth it, you and not somebody else, with T6 you are at 13k hp raidbuffed, you're an unkillable turret, what is fed to you is never a loss, you transform it into something greater, your raid group knows it and they oblige, not out of fear, but happily, knowing they are serving the greater good, their winged demon god that they rely on, you, the warlock
Also this take is cringe, not denying 54% isnt good coming from 40% avg but the fight is pretty short, its not a high % for a 100
Double lust is not up to chances and having excess lusts is just what a non 🤡 raid comp looks like
Getting doom assign is not something "unfair", you get doom assign because you make more of it than the other warlocks which is a result of gameplay, you outplayed them so you get to doom, its only fair. Now you know whats cringe? Rotating dooms like a commie because thats "fair", imagine cucking a pumper having him watch a boomer on doom, seeing him overwrite it with agony, thats not fair, its video game communism
Not everyone can be the best, they still strive to be the best version of themselves, even if theyll never doom because I exist
Resultcrafting is the optimal path to warlock understanding, this is a race to be the best and every non resultcrafter is losing it. The feelscrafter crashed out in lap 1 because he felt entering turn 7 with 200 km/h would be slow enough while it wasn't, the theorycrafter crashed out in lap 9 thinking in theory there should not be another racer blocking his path in turn 3 while there was and the resultcrafter is racing successfully to victory because he considers all changing conditions and regularly checks his rear mirror. Dont sim, dont feel, just play and you'll win.
Mages are past their prime, theyre out, giving a mage skull over a warlock would be like when a medic arrives at a car crash site and decides to treat the 91 old dude with terminal cancer instead of the 17 year old healthy guy with all his life ahead
The real argument for ZD to shadow priest is that 70 stamina helping them not die to random shit all the time, causing their debuffs to wear off
If healspls is in my raid other warlocks will have to apply coe and cor, he'll get to be the special one, applying curse of weakness, perfectly resembling what he is
Half of zeph guide is just recycling my toc, nethervoid and gemming takes
Yet I never saw a penny
Was just a blind shot, falsly implying I read zeph guides, or any guides really, lol
What happens with guides most of the time is that noone actually reads them, plebs with no understanding of the game will have an argument and pull them up to look at lists, this is where Zeph fails us because his guide says "this other slightly inferior item works too", just that nobody reads that, just sees whats listed, then you end up with warlocks thinking its ok to wear Kael cloak, smh, I can do it better with less effort, just pull up my profile on classic.warcrafogs.com, theres your guide, enjoy
Im all for Zephan writing guides and all, but did he even hit level 70 yet?
We are mostly getting abused by admins to act as a massive brainstorming chamber for their content, they dont contribute shit, just stop by every now and then to harvest what we produced, instead of standing up people even simp admins when they come here
And the mods dont even play the game anymore, or at least they try to hide it, jpaint is the only mod I know that is playing the game and I only know because his poor play has become a meme
Theres always just 1 active warlock trainer, the position changes similarly like the one in Hogwarts for teaching defense against the dark magics
Then there are random ass ranks noone knows or cares about, you probably have to donate or send dickpick to admins for a rare rank
When randos in WoW think of "the warlock discord" they think of a very sweaty and utterly desicated place but when you get to the core of it its actually very pathetic and barely any top players take part in discussion here
Today Ive received private questions about parsing and boweaving, basically doing what the ranks are supposed to be doing
This place is in a sorry state, Id compare it to the fallen Roman Empire but that would imply that it was once great, which it probably never was, its consistently underwhelming and non great, similar to the sexual lives of the participants
If I had sex for each good parse Id have more offspring than Genghis Khan
People think I "get" double lusted but technically I dont, Im the one swapping the players and demanding the lust in voice chat, so I double lust myself, its an active thing, gameplay
I perform those motions while playing flawlessly still, np
The spellpen shills will lose
WCL will ban mage kiting and open partition 3.6
Spell pen and mage kiting is CCC, cringe, clown and coomer
You dont move away you just transition to being on the mage as the default target
You lose dps and dignity
Just snacks so far no meal yet
I got griefed by our sp and yet rank 15 still
Would be 100 without sp griefing
Rank 6 world, sucks so hard to be a losers
What is this fly in my rear mirror
Oh nvm its gone again
Most of my parses were without gear
Stop coping noob
I just use 4p t6 it seems more consistent to me

I would only go tailor AFTER obtaining the pattern (which is tradeable btw but will probably cost an absolute fortune), if you switch to tailor beforehand because of planning with that robe then youre really asking for a lot of luck
his guild is archi cheesing producing invalid logs LMAO
your guild
it put the invalid part first in the overview for whatever reason
but hannu has to work on positioning
1 air burst cast on him
but he ate 3 in total from standing next to plebs
rhonin has been anti shilled by cringe listemakers even though theres absolutely nothing wrong with picking it up when its an upgrade u just have to make sure your loot distribution understands its not a real item
just swap to the mage, spell pen on council is a meme
"shitpost"?
a second shadow priest existing is even more reason for you to be shadow warlock
what is this shit
get this low ass fire warlock convo out of my sight
its dead
deal with it

T6 is made for orc nothing else
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/823471727081422849/942485521530236958/unknown.png
orc above all
uds should hit delete button
im getting drake tomorrow 2k rep off
meh
Either you think orc is clown or you think its beast, I think it looks beast but its always like that, races with good traits automatically look good to me, its kinda similar with how some girls will start finding ugly men attractive if they have a lot money
just being efficient and consistent
if ud had the orc racial and orc didnt I would be shilling ud, its consistent and logical
I havent even peaked yet
Its all coming together
I'll achieve world rank 1, im 6 already
Then locktalk podcast will invite me
And i'll make the helicopter with my dick and take off to the moon
the problem with boweaving right now, at least within my raid group, is the tank aggro, boweaving causes a very big dmg and therefore aggro spike just like quag's eye, our tanks couldnt handle it
I'm already looking forward to exchanging quag's for skull or motc, the spike is too scary
or looking forward to getting real tanks
its not about what is a tiny bit better than the other but what causes you not to be tanking the boss all of a sudden and non omegahaste proc trinkets have their dps gain strechted out over longer periods of time
I could probably tank winterchill, the guy hits very weak
scroll of armor should do
with earth shield casting should be fine and you can get backlash procs
I see positives only
I got 12.5k raidbuffed
there should be a paladin in my group though
who cycles between armor and ret aura so I can deal more dmg and survive
you can get quite some extra armor going in total, have a paladin loh you before pull, shamans crit you
its also worse then when your tanks cant handle the early aggro spike
also this has further negative implications, like if that is a consideration, you're not gonna be boweaving either which is even more dmg loss
Ill just boweave instead of using quags
you dont want to buffer threat when your buffs look like this, you want to blast like a maniac, and this is also the most efficient time for quag proc
running double icon trinkets but then boweaving beats quags in sims
get illidan head and sit it out with that until you get vashj, taking mh pants from other classes is bad

К сожалению здесь есть много дурака
Но есть хорошие люди тоже
Ты думаешь?
Меня зовут Газгаз и эта не проблема
Газ не плохо
Я люблю тебя
Нет
У меня нет сто рублей, но у меня сто друзей
Я не понимаю что проблема с Газ
Нет
И что будет если нет?
Дискорд это скоростная трасса
И мой машина очень быстро
if my name is "bad" or not is up to interpretation, and on my previous server it was just "Gas" which at least was more rare
"gas!" or "Gas, gas!" means "speed up the car!"
or anything really
we have speed limits on all of our highways
but not in our cellars
wait what
its similar to the non existing speed limit in our raids, you can go as fast as you can but not overnuking the tank is recommended because it will result in a crash
they arent really science, they just kind of happen naturally similar to trinket procs, sometimes I have some and sometimes I dont and sometimes they come to me at the completely wrong time
my analogies are like a box of chocolate, you never know what you're going to get
I could write in analogies only, but it would feel forced and confusing like unplanned buttsex
there are no planned stops for this analogy train
I could think of better analogies but a good horse only jumps as high as its required and this does it for the audience at hand
mods can't stop me like the police can't arrest natural desasters, I'm vis maior unfolding
I simmed it and its worth
ok sec

the summary only shows the weapon the fight started with
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Pg7Lr2tzavTRpdQD#fight=69&type=auras&source=8&ability=38317
I'll boweave next raid again
it was pre nerf
these are the chains holding me back and yet Im thriving
no just bad raid dps
it improved but its still worse than for example your raid dps
yet youre still getting incredibly small in my rear mirror
basically yes, if theres enough time left for the proc to happen + to make full use of it
if you have a bunch of buffs going like destro pot and trinket I suggest waiting for a bit with the swap until those ran out
better to have the icd when less buffs are active
quags if they can hold threat

this is my SB castime when the bowiz proc occurs with lust + drums, wearing 1x haste ring and haste bracers
if I can find another item with haste to push it below 1.5 that will mean another cast will snapshot the proc
that will result in boweaving being absolutely massive
You can just in any case get rid of it after 20 seconds when icon ran out
On average will be worth
Tapping during lust is no loss, its a loss when you have +spell buffs active
The chance it procs within the first 20 seconds is very high like 80%
Its 15% proc chance
Tapping during lust can be a net positive move depending on how the cast timings work out
Nah the +dmg buffs are at the start and then no longer if you got rid of 2p t4 already
You only have hyjal ring proc high chance it procs early, long icd
4p T6 and haste to push cast time below 1.5 are big boweaving enablers
I need to bring this up when they distribute the next skull
Lockcord irl meetup :monkaS:
@Hannu since you have skull but no p3 weapon you should absolutely be boweaving, having skull active during lust and drums means your cast time goes below 1.5 seconds when bowiz procs which means instead of 4 casts 5 casts will benefit from the bowiz proc, since drums last 30 seconds you should get a proc within that timeframe in 90% of cases
on top of being the optimal play on average you increase the height of your highs because you implement an element to your damage equation that is semi-consistent only
so the likelihood of parsing a 100 increases
swap the trigger in the 2nd one to the weapon youre using
or change it to bowiz and hit inverse button
yes
unless you have a p3 weapon
exported the boweaving weak aura again so it works without changes needed
I parsed rank 5 on winterchill without it
just get good lol
my mate parsed 100 on anetheron without 4p t6, without p3 weapon and without skull
just get good
yes
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/venoxis/bloody
so there are 2 breakpoints to watch which when you hit make boweaving incredible strong: <1.5s procced shadow bolt cast time while lusted and <2s while not lusted, you should be able to hit those either by having skull or having haste rings + waistwrap, then the amount of proc affected shadow bolt casts increases from 4 to 5 and from 3 to 4 respectively which is obviously yuge
youre not boweaving despite having skull and no p3 weapon, so youre not playing as optimally as you could be, far from skillcap
its not a meme its literally what you should absolutely be doing if you dont have a p3 weapon but skull
if ur not a boweaver ur not rly trying tbh, if boweaving was built into warlock via talents and it was included in Hildis sim to show you that its worth, youd all be doing it like zombies no questions asked
youre so god damn bad for not boweaving with skull because you hit crucial boweaving breakpoints with skull literally a wasted item on you as a player
@Hannu You can talk shit about boweaving all you want, you're wearing quag's eye over icon on bosses which means you're essentially already boweaving anyway. You're sacrificing static stats (spell) as a trade for a 6 second haste proc chance which is exactly the same as boweaving, just that boweaving is even better than wearing quag's. Quag's has a 45 second icd and only a 10% proc chance. Bowiz has a 15% proc chance and thanks to boweaving only a 20 second icd. Not boweaving when you have skull and no p3 weapon while wearing quags is fucking 🤡
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Tbt1VAWQwh9DyJNr#fight=18&type=summary&source=27
?
@Hannu nice trinkets for winterchill bossfight https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Tbt1VAWQwh9DyJNr#fight=9&type=summary&source=27
on najentus you used quags over icon, you might aswell be boweaving
im so eager to check the t6 shoulders of all the p1 scryer shills "youll run naxx anyway" KEK
imagine not boweaving while wearing quags on bosses
wrong tho
anyone know shaggy char name?
I only found "Gaysimp" on wcl
he was talking trash on me pre p1 about how his pumper guild is gonna farm all of naxx and everyone will have sapph enchant
I want to go see those t6 shoulders with sapph enchant
doesnt have t6 shoulders yet did put sapph on t4, will see
didnt farm exalted ring, no enchant on respectful ring :peepohigh:
with skull you get below 1.5s sb castime during bowiz proc allowing 5 casts to benefit (during lust), thats very powerful, idk how its so hard to understand
ill do it
problem is I dont get below 1.5s yet
with lust + drums Im at 1.519s casttime when bowiz procs
if I had skull that would push it below 1.5, allowing 5 casts to benefit instead of 4
when you wear ZD youre not wearing bowiz
boweaving is exactly the same as wearing quags over icon its just too complex of a thing to comprehend for some but in essence its nothing else, just even stronger
no I dont because Ive done it in practice and it worked perfectly fine, lol
your raiddps peaked at 30k which is pretty low
they had a bit more in previous wipes but still not enough
you killed the boss so you had enough dps
meh, with that raiddps obviously you can find a lot of suboptimal things happening you can point out and feel "superior" about
I think theres a difference between "most of the raid died and we ended up 10-manning the boss" and legit having dogshit raiddps
I wonder if some guild will manage to 0 shield najentus, the fastest kill time is already at 1:26
before swp gear that is, then its obviously not that hard
you can either first agony and then doom or if you trust in your raid's ability to not take ages with popping the shield you can do something like corruption->doom->sb spam
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/792426090655645716/942797679505842187/unknown.png
this was my raid giga griefing the shield
if you pop early enough the doom is fine
if you dont have results to show and I cant respect you as a player, neither can I take your opinions on "theorycrafting" serious, this is about results, transforming input into output, not woulda coulda shoulda
isnt pre-spawning this guy low key op? he just single handedly killed a 6k life basilisk for me before dying
if youre about being "optimal" then youre not running an ele in sunwell, making toc better than zd
wrong
paladin you need the buff
prot pala really useless in sunwell only useful for felmyst and muru
swp has more dmg incoming than bt and requires more healers
hannu just staright up spreading misinformation all day
Heals has decent takes sometimes but hes in a garbage raid so I cant respect him, Hannu is in a decent raid but he has garbage takes so I cant respect him, they add up to a nice little clown fiesta
bruh Im rank 6 world I could probably go AFK for the rest of the phase and you wouldnt catch up, it would be like my ferrari broke and you're trying to catch up in a soapbox - uphill
if I get skull then Ill boweave because then I hit <1.5s breakpoint
my parses happened without 4p mostly
bruh like I have to "demand" doom
its not a question
I demand earth shield not doom
so where did I even say something else lol
This guy is coping so hard 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We have standard non retard raid comp and hes upset his guild couldnt gather the brain cells to do the same
We want exactly these warlocks and not cut one and its ok to bring one and thats the single only nitpick for you to find, 3% dmg
Congratz
For Heals I will need a space telescope as rear mirror
Its ok let me ancestors know when you passed jupiter
I had to find a guild casual enough so that my new to WoW girlfriend would fit in and I still dunk on him without even looking 😂
no the context was Heals, noobs that arent delusional about what theyre doing are fine
ding ding
its ogre
guy is from vienna
he already lost
when kited does the guy not cast because hes running around or because he doesnt cast from bagdad?
ok then strat is obv
kiting mage is for giganoobs
and the log heals pointed out had the warlock triple lusted
the double standards
bruh I could focus the priest and still I would need a lense to even spot you in my rear mirror
I mean obviously hes baiting even he will know that he cant be taken serious from his position, it would be like some highschool football kid telling Tom Brady how to throw the ball
no I just went for the analogy I knew you would understand because Im capable of adapting to my opponents like the Ditto pokemon
theres no point in minor speed on mother, youre not hitting any movement speed breakpoints with it, you just zoom straight back to the boss with rocket boots, its better to have vitality on boots for that 4 mp 5 allowing another cast every 6th kill
Generally, and this is especially true for t6 because here most fights are stationary, the value of movement speed correlates negatively with the level of boomerism in your guild, the more boomer your guild is the less likely you are to bottleneck the guild's progression within the raid due to a lack of movement speed. Some guilds are so boomer that you could be playing the whole raid with the hamstring debuff and you wouldn't be holding them back.
vitality enchant is bis for most bosses tho which is a fact
Id say let your shaman have some fun too 🙂
any class is supposed to be played with pot cd on cd, whatever that pot is...
its kind of like arcane mage the art is to be at 0 mana when the boss dies without ooming before that except that they deal like half the dmg only
implying if a guild doesnt do split runs (read as: increasing complexity of organisation 10 fold, not getting to raid properly for half the phase) theyre not "serious" about playing some 15 year old game is a giga 🤡  view
if you bring aff it should be last on 4p t6 of the warlocks but it should get prio on toc, chronicles and ros neck
if the aff has ele it should get nothing
depends on the context, you can be kind of a shit player but if the other warlocks are on the level of heals you should get all loot, vice versa you could be a decent player but if the other warlocks are 3x gasgas youre not seeing much loot any soon
The strongest argument for getting skull is the fact that it lets you hit the <1.5s casttime boweaving breakpoint
Boweavers should have hard prio on skull
Have you tried Heals guild?
Anyone know Heals character name and server? I need something to laugh at
So the guy is so irrelevant noone even knows it 😂
You dont have to but if you're gonna talk shit you better have skin in the game otherwise you're just some clown from the sidelines noone cares about
Its just like with those people who keep talking about how the stock market is gonna crash without actually buying puts or shorting anything
@Healspls Put your money where your mouth is
youre like those small degen dogs that go bark at big dogs and then come back whining to their owner when the big dogs arent on a leash
we take care of you
just be real about what it is
Jpaint secretly loves me but hes fighting it, its like when the male actor in the porn is too attractive to ignore but you dont wanna admit
@jpaint Qui tacet, consentire videtur
99% of guilds dumb af
this whole council spell pen thing is such an amazing display of how low and lazy the gameplay of classic players is, like instead of coordinating something for once and not being bad at the game everyone immediately flocks to the cookie cutter solution and shills it because god forgive they end up getting outplayed on the boss
you get better results
like literally not a single active person in this discord has better result on council than me
yet you shill this shit
get out lmao
I mean lets not pretend like coordinating the target on council is hard, its just that this is indeed the pathetic state of classic players
chinese council logs dont count they probably would lose social score for focusing the mage because hes the 4th member of the council which is an unlucky number
he doesnt have to put up on both
you all just too stupid to fucking undderstand what a coordination is
I would rather be assfucked every now and then than be permanently cucked
what the fuck is a "good" guild? the purpose of a guild is for people to come together and play the game which people do to have fun, so as long as people within a guild are having fun its ex definitione a good guild no matter their objective performance in raids and Id argue that many "hardcore" guilds out there have much shittier mood than more laid back guilds
theres a difference between judging a guild based on being a guild and judging their performance when their goal is to have good raids, if theres a guild with the primary focus on having weird sexual RP in the last corner of undercity and thats what they do, Im not going to say its a bad guild just because they arent clearing raids, its not my type of guild but if talking about guild quality it may aswell be the best guild in all of wow, nobody knows, absolutely possible
the game is fine its just that the playerbase consisting of consoomers forged by a performance society are sucking the soul out of it
when the game was made it was made by lighthearted devs for lighthearted players and now the players playing said game have a 10 ft pole stuck in their ass crafted by social media bubbles and corporation asking for MORE MORE and MORE
bruh neither do I participate in social media nor do my actions resemble anything that would be anticapitalist (I own many stocks) Im just being real
farming can be very mind soothing, you just have to get into the mood of it, and you could be listening to an audiobook while doing it
today I made a goal of completing as many daily quests as I can possibly find, so its not about the gold grind anymore, the focus shifted to something more interesting, yet I still get the gold income as a side effect
instead of farming consumables, resources or completing daily quests like intended by the devs the gold making meta has shifted almost entirely towards services, transforming things like effort, time or accomplishment into gold (boosting, gdkp, rent a tank) and no T6 paladins farming Strat was not on the dev's mind when they created the game,
everything on my server is cheap as fuck and nobody can convince me its not the work of bots
We have bots that act more or less normally and join player made dungeon groups as if they were a normal player its honestly spooky
theyre so realistic its hard to tell if theyre a bot or just a retard thats why its spooky
they are like this now... imagine in 50 years when you join them in the retirement home, god I hope I will be able to afford my own ai nurses
on AVERAGE there will be 4 skulls for a raid that clears weekly until swp
blasting people in battleground with 4p t6 is so fun, youre full glass cannon but still got a decent hp pool because of how amazing t6 is
the best part is when pvp warlocks send their pet on you and trigger a backlash proc which ends up being their death sentence
I get more people complimenting my wings than my dps even tho my dps is yuge
yesterday on vashj someone on voice was like "wtf is that mob" and then he realized "oh thats just the wings of our t6 warlock"
hannu is in a non serious guildwhere they dont try to get max value out of healers eg by running as few as they can or having them deal a lot of dmg too thats why he has problems understanding the value of those items
using pen
pathetic
current circus directors: heals, hannu, xelrog
everyone else clown
feel privileged
oh no out of 100k warlocks there were 15 or so above me
how can it be possible
he must be doing it wrongly
weaving giga sucked because the sp didnt do his job also the mage could have been positioned better for the shadow to reach him, theres optimization to be done, meanwhile braindead spellpen "strat" is just cookie butter and already peaked, I had about no weaving and all and you still look like an ant in my rear mirror, spell pen in 🤡 deal with it son
I dont need excuses for being top 20 out of 100k
Im saying what we did had a lot of potential to be even better than it already was meanwhile the chinese probably sweated out their cookie cutter strat on PTR
@Healspls get fucked the cult has spoken
oh no im 20 out of 100k while youre 70k out of 100k or something idk ur too irrelevant for anyone to know your char name
wearing spellpen so you can afk the fight is not optimizing its the opposite
youre not 5Head for gathering spellpen pieces
what are the useful optimizations you are performing while youre shadow bolting the paladin only?
the red area is THE ONLY TIME we werent able to dps optimally, oh noes.... have to gimp my output potential with spellpen
oh shit
oh shit
guys
I need help
please
please help
what can I do
HALF A SHADOWBOLT WENT INTO RES AURA
WHAT CAN I DO
this guy is calling shadow bolt spam a rotation
im already in contact with our shadow priest about the council matter
no he gains dps from multidotting
also when was this cult ever concerned about how SPs feel about shit LOL
I ordered to have the mage positioned a bit more closely to the raid to make things easier for the shadow priest, also the shadow priest confirmed he will improve his weavings
you see you dont get it, he can take his time with getting weaving up as long as the paladin doesnt have the aura up, no warlock needs to swap back to the mage as long as theres no aura
damage not useful? ok
no but the guy in charge is big time hunter simp even though every single hunter we ever got sucked hard
where is what
its so funny how youre trying to make assumptions from our logs without knowing shit about our guild (and while being too much of a pussy to share your own) our guild is neither a speedrun guild (too many with casual attitude) nor a parse guild, just a guild trying to play the content in decent manner, in that context not a single thing in the raid is out of the ordinary
the only thing out of the ordinary is the aff which is 3% dmg WOW, and he exists for player reasons not for having an aff, we didnt have an aff for all of T5
??
I have no business in what the physicals are doing, I have always been telling get a 2nd enhancer you clowns but it hasnt happened so far or theyre saying that 2nd one is busy with work or something
I have always been telling to build 1 stronk physical group that serves as a strong 2nd lust receiving group
I cant tell them how to do every single thing without slipping into leadership positions myself which I have no desire to do
still waiting to hear what can be interpreted as "warlock simping" except the aff which is a player thing
its not in the context of the guild we are which is neither speedrun nor parse guild
wrong
I gave hunters the extra lust on karathress for example because there it was stronger for them, but you wanna know the reason why it was mostly the warlocks receiving 2nd lust? Because group 1 and 2 were literally too bad at the game to perform the swap, they couldnt be asked to do it, they would fuck up their "rotations" swapping
and the primary thing you dont get is that a decent raidcomp has 2 extra lusts anyway, one for warlocks one for physicals, none of that is "simping" just not being giga dogshit like your guild
last raid we had 2 extra lusts and one went to melees and one to warlocks and the hunters didnt get one because the leader hates them, and in most cases warlocks make the most of a 2nd lust anyway
I dont even make the doom assignment
I called the guy a slug that had stormcaller until last raid because he couldnt be bothered farming something better and that got himself banned for the t6 progress because he bought gold I have no problem calling this guy out for that, I respect him for what he is and hes decent enough at warlock but that doesnt mean that ill make the whiteknight for him regarding doom
@Healspls honestly semi giga disgusting how youre making assumptions and judging off of logs, tells more about you and your frustrated existence than anything else
I also had stormcaller before that retard
we had mageblade dropping and he wasnt in the raid because of meh attendance
we did do some gruul splits
- attend the raids so he gets one of the 2 mageblades that did drop but he wasnt there to loot them
- buy bowiz because literally better on its own than stormcaller and good for seeding either way
- get points for free pvp weapon 
- go kara for dagger (I went there more often than him just for enchant formulas)
im not giving myself any prio, we have a loot council which Im not a part of
the slug warlock isnt even off badly, hes the 2nd to be filled 4p t6 despite missing the first raid because of being banned and hes at 2/4 right now, also he got najentus dagger which is a big upgrade from stormcaller or even would have been decent upgrade from t4 weapon
the other pumper warlock got the skull because that was only fair, they didnt think through the distribution beforehand
yeah
our raid did ssc yesterday
and we only killed vashj, they failed to log it
I was all for clearing everything especially leo obv
and I was very upset about us not killing leo and me wasting my id
no because I have an id
fucking retard
this guy is a literal joke
after not killing leo yesterday I told leadership
next time were doing leo or im not joining your vashj belt farming only
because then I rather go pug
so shut the fuck up worthless piece of shit
im the last person on earth that will not go a pug for an upgrade
yeah sure because people will join no vashj ssc
if I want to be the joke of the server I go open a no vashj ssc
so thats basically, you a fucking joke of a person
where did I say I lost my mind? so first leadership makes me get slowfall cape so I can sneak to lurker ramp before the raid and then summon everyone to that place so we have to do 1 trashpack only and then they announce we're only doing vashj after the fact even though we did other bosses too the previous raids, so I said well if thats what we'll be doing in the future Im not joining because I would rather join a pug for an actual chance at my weapon
my guild said we're transferring and I followed
they didnt say we would be doing vashj only, they said it after vashj was dead, soberly I said well Im not joining in on vashj only in the future
if it were me, we would be doing all of t5 and naxx that day, not just vashj, kael, gruul
yes like they make a raid happen for 3 bosses and then its a problem to add a 4th boss where you get a decent weapon upgrade for caster and tsnuami talisman? it wasnt even a given that I would get the weapon, I just wanted to do a boss that has loot thats still relevant
they could have given fang the other warlock thats still running a t4 weapon because that guy isnt gonna pvp for s2 weapon
I will pvp for s3 weapon, I couldnt be bothered for s2 weapon at the time
next time I will just prio WoW Classic TBC over my law degree sounds resonable
dont give a shit about your opinion
in any case pvping for gear is not required in our guild but attending as many raids as the guild is holding is desired, so I dont understand how Im at fault with weapon
and it was me to say give toc prio to the aff because the guy is stuck in a group without ele so he makes the most of toc, and me to say give ZD to sp/boomkin/ele because they cant wield swords and warlocks have a lot of other stuff theyre getting, which is why I wasnt happy with not killing Leo because im not getting a weapon upgrade from raids soon and why Ive started pvping again for s3 weapon if weapon drops stay shit
all of the assumptions being made, baseless, disgraceful
the list of things I did outside of raid to get better performance inside the raid that other warlocks within my raid didnt do is very long
@Xelrog tell me Heals character and server name so I can join the baseless assumptions and accusations game
liking my takes or not is one thing, going on a personal accusation spree without any base the other
youre too scared to even have your logs shared
literal human trash
long list of implications like "you dont want the other warlocks in your raid to enjoy the game"
even making obviously wrong assumptions and accusations like "ditching my guild for a better server" when the logs show the guild on my new and old server is the same
not everyone, just you
Im not self pitying, im just calling you out for what you are, a piece of worthless shit, and youre blocked until your logs are public pussy
Dont bypass my block, I inversed yours
Wheres the pasta about having to unblock someone because they say too much bullshit for people to object? I feel that one now
Nah
His messages are worthless for me to read so I dont need to see them
Well theres a difference, most people dont have special things to contribute and thats ok and they dont have results that make me have to at least listen to them yet I still deal with them, Heals is that kind of person, but having added baseless diacrediting on top of it makes it a negative move to deal with him at all, it's like when you dont kill flys out of principle but then one gets just annoying enough for you to kill it regardless of having had that principle
you could say the chat reformed after having cut the worthless out of it
think it was a 10 dps upgrade when I simmed it
With Heals banned a new slot on the director board is open

have you tried frost resistance gear?
last raid I picked up 4p t6 mid raid and my SB crits went from 10,650 max to 11,217 so it was only 5% and a complete scam
so typically balanced raids want 3 warlocks for their warlock group which means they will probably want 4 warlocks for the roster because 3 people will not achieve 100% attendance, so you easily end up with 4 warlocks in the raid and one of them has to be in the shitty group, at that point he might aswell be playing aff
theres no point, he just rejects objectively true statements without putting anything material forward, like not accepting that boweaving is worth it with skull (and no p3 wep) because of <1.5s casttime, like its blatantly obvious that is the case, yet he doesnt do it, but then talks about rdps
there should be a parse for overall dmg and it should be the most important
guilds entering BT when sunwell is out is as much of a meme as guilds going Naxx when T5 is out
depends on the guild, for many players when they downed KJ the game is over and everything else is a bonus, theyll give swp 4-5 more ids to put the insane gear to work and thats it
my guild couldnt even be asked to kill leo last raid when we did vashj, despite one of the two ferals needing tsnunami and the weapon being an upgrade for casters, you could pay these people and they wouldnt go BT when Sunwell is out
The administration wasn't sure about Xelrog's application to the board of directors for this circus, but when they heard that he chose Transcendence over Venoxis for his free transfer to another server, he instantly got the job.
motc is a downgrade over eye
spellpen on council is cringe, the epitome of classic boomers attempting to dumb down everything as much as they can
I have top 20 parse even though my sp misexecuted on the plan, just get good boomers
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/823471727081422849/943198252101140541/unknown.png
better have spellpen for half a shadow bolt that could go into res
no its not this is exactly what is happening, the playerbase of this game is so fucking bad at playing it they look for everything, archimonde cheese supports that claim
top is magic shield on the mage bottom is res aura on the paladin
for shit raids yes
good raids spread enough so that not 5 people get knocked up at the same time
""best strategy"" in the context of your raid consisting of incapable boomers maybe
I dont see a single person active in this discord above me
so stfu
because we raid early in the id lmao
ofc its dropping afterwards
gather some brain cells inbred
like everyone else in a non clown setup
look whos talking about contribution lmao
at least im on topic
youre just useless spam
even warlock trainer admits the merit of focusing mage so stfu
look Im proposing something with merit (braincells exist) whereas the guy who literally never contributes anything says my ranks are dropping when we raid on thursday
your best bet for most efficient uptime is being on the paladin whenever the aura isnt up, because on the paladin the sp can ensure that weaving is up always and you cant get your cast cancelled by magic bop, this is 50% of the time, for the other 50% youre attacking the mage hoping magic bop isnt up on him which half the time overlaps with you attacking the paladin anyway, so youre looking at 3% on average, maybe
if you actually looked at the log you would see that id have the #1 parse had the sp done a better job with weaving on the mage, its fairly obvious that something that requires a bit of coordination isnt gonna work as well the first time compared to a cookie cutter solution
I mean its a lot easier to maintain weaving on just the paladin I dont even know what youre talking about, your input is completely useless
this was weaving on the mage when 38.34% of my damage was on the mage and youre telling me because it was rank 20 instead of rank 1 im donezo, sure
what about this guy wearing spell pen getting 3 lusts and ending up below me? https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/HYZ3RhbmKLxD4y7k#fight=54&type=damage-done
the purpose of sharing my rank on this boss is to support my claim on how to play the boss and not to brag, I dont need to brag about single boss parses when im rank 9 world overall
blocked
noone with honest intentions can look at this and not admit that what was here could have been a lot more optimal compared to the ranks above, a lot more room for improvement in terms of execution compared to just focusing the paladin with spellpen
this is just the part of the sp that went wrong, very possible I screwed up too sometimes with my switching, much room for improvement and our guild wasnt active on PTR, I bet you most guilds parsing high on that boss this early into the phase were active on PTR, you dont spend epic gems on spell pen gear on a whim
and I dont even know where this discussion culture is coming from where any argument brought forward is just dismissed as copium, yeah me making the point that my result had a lot more upside potential still than the others is copium, at that point you can quit and just declare anything the hivemind approves as the eternal truth, Ive seen it in discussions unrelated to wow too, not my opinion and can be interpreted as justification? its cOpiUm. nice future for this society
I was only hostile to hostility and the chatlog proves it
its not hostile its just the truth
idk where that notion is coming from, while you have to put on a penis extender to penetrate the front door I just go for the back door
boweaving literally not a meme if you have skull but no p3 weapon, with skull you can push the cast speed on proc below 1.5s which means you get 5 shadow bolts affected it instead of 4, this is during lust, its the same outside of lust where you can go below 2.0 for 4 shadow bolts rather than 3
I ran the sim on boweaving with skull and the results are very amazing

I simmed 20 seconds only, when boweaving the assumption is that after the first 20 seconds you can make a damage neutral tap (which swaps your weapon)
all fights are 20s fights for boweavers, afterwards everything is equal again
after you swapped the weapon with a damage neutral tap the fight ends
the possiblity that bowiz doesnt proc at all in those 20 sec is included in the sim
like honestly how can anyone put off a more than 300 dps expansion of peak peak dps
well I dont have skull and the sim says boweaving without skull not so great
you dont necessarily need skull, you just need enough haste to push the proc below 1.5s cast time during lust, so maybe supremus belt would be enough
the sim actually makes it worse than it is because the sim ends at 20 seconds which could be 2 seconds into an active proc, but you wouldnt make such a stupid decision in real life
you only have a dead weapon in 20% of cases, in 80% of cases youre in gigachad mode
you can cut your losses after 20 seconds when the skull active runs out, its like having a stop loss in place for when you buy stocks
when skull active runs out boweaving is not worth it anymore so you perform a damage neutral tap, and on average that will be a very dps-profitable thing to do
if its not skull pushing you below 1.5s but items, which is possible, then you have the 20 seconds of icon active serving for that, but in theory achieving <1.5s casts without skull should enable more reckless boweaving
for the first 20 seconds boweaving can make up for the fact that you dont have a p3 weapon, it sims exactly the same like ToC (given you reach the haste breakpoint) or in other words: boweaving with a p3 weapon is damage neutral, anything below that a damage gain
when boweaving I recommend using motc or icon above quag, that way you can get the most out of boweaving, boweaving is basically a substitution for quag that enables other trinkets
well you can have every single fight be a 15s fight with boweaving by performing a damage neutral tap after 15 seconds, always
Id recommend doing so after 20s tho because of trinkets
its not half a meme when you reach the haste breakpoint necessary, people here have done way more for less
300+ peak dmg increase over t4 weapon nothing to laugh at, its too significant to rest ignored
you still had 100+ less dps than me, youre only rank 9 because the partition is less than a day old, oh wait its already rank 10
its not like there wasnt room for improvement for my result either https://discord.com/channels/253210018697052162/823471727081422849/943508669805522994
ok but this was like 0% weaving, and weaving doesnt have to be up instantly, just when I swap back to the mage
I dont need things to be reliable, just better on average, thats why I believe in boweaving
just swap out after 20s trinket is done even if it didnt proc, that way you cut your losses but it will still proc like 80% of the time, also make sure youre hitting the haste breakpoint necessary for 5 casts affected during lust (<1.5s casttime)
you can hit that breakpoint either by using skull or by having haste bracers + 1 haste ring + waistwrap
personally I dont have either but Ill bring forward boweaving as an argument as to why I need those items
@Louki why am I unable to contribute my research on boweaving to the tbc-research channel? Id call a peak dps increase of 80 dps and a peak peak dps increase of 400 dps over t4 weapon significant enough to be worth displaying to the general public
noone is even saying I was wrong thats just you, everyone else is saying cba, but more and more people have been giving it a try
you dont need a specific implementation, running 20 second sims is enough, you just assume that you can perform a dps neutral tap after that which in reality you can
??? the chance to not get a proc is included when you sim it, and its not a big assumption almost every single t6 fight is turret-style
I never even tried to use it until now, why can I not use it? That channel is full about dps increases less significant than boweaving, boweaving deserves to be heard
Its funny because people keep talking about how warlock parsing is irrelevant because everyone just presses the same button all the time, now I bring forward a method of increasing dps by pressing more buttons and everyone hates on it?? smh
I already put forward the substance as to why boweaving with either skull or 3 haste pieces is very worth it when you dont have a p3 weapon in this channel, just baseless discrediting happening again
but I did
bowiz is a part of the sim already
you can know very reliably on which bosses you can perform damage neutral taps, and some are doing those already anyway to stagger aggro
like if you ever tapped early to delay aggro, you already boweaved
ur just kinda confirming how amazing boweaving is for peak dmg
its no difference, youre not supposed to be wearing quag's when boweaving, but non boweavers probably are, all youre doing is exchange 10% proc chance (quags) for 15% proc chance (bowiz)
its funny how people are happy to bring this forward about a 15% proc chance while they have no issue wearing quag's with a 10% proc chance
you cant cut quag icd to 20s 80% of the time
if you could weave quag's everyone would be doing it no questions asked, it would essentially be the same as boweaving, yet people are sceptical about boweaving because they somehow just cant comprehend it, its like people back then thinking black magic is happening when electric light was first introduced so theyd rather keep using their stupid ass candles
if they havent figured out by now that skull is hardprio on lock then that is a strong indicator for the guild also being dogshit in other areas
nah I believe you can place them at any boss
if I get either skull or a third haste piece before getting a p3 weapon I'll provide one
Schopenhauer on The Skull of Gul'dan: “For if anything in the world is desirable, so desirable that even the dull and uneducated herd in its more reflective moments would value it more than silver and gold, it is that a ray of light should fall on the obscurity of our existence, and that we should obtain some information about this enigmatical life of ours, in which nothing is clear except its misery and vanity.”
when they added the paladin and his resistance aura the devs intention was that casters should not attack the paladin then, and we should respect the game they made for us
no
spellpeners are the actual copers not chad mage swappers who still see the light of the most optimal outcome
wanted to check what ryu is doing on council, found out he was already running 4p last id which certain people have been "calling me out" for because of "funneling" or whatever, lmao
I dont need, if people want to be ignorant about boweaving thats their loss
Ill just take the 400 point increase in peak peak dps and laugh all the way to the leaderboards
Id be boweaving here and now with the most amazing results youve ever seen but it only really shines if you hit the haste breakpoint of <1.5s casts during lust which you achieve either by having skull or 3 pieces of haste gear (eg bracers, ring and belt) and I check neither of those boxes right now
”What the herd hates most is the one who thinks differently; it is not so much the opinion itself, but the audacity of wanting to think for themselves, something that they do not know how to do.” (Schopenhauer on Mayhem's fight for boweaving)
he got some things right and some things wrong, but since the things he got wrong can easily be dismissed and the things he got right he got very right, I'd say there are higher highs for listening to him rather than to the average more compliant and "correct" thinker
I performed boweaving in p2 and the logs of me doing that exist and Ive shared them here, healpls is just a clown that has nothing better to do all day than discrediting me on no basis, basically deserves to be banned tbh
and what about this?
imagine getting mad at another classes discord, if you cant convince your own guild about reasoned loot prios, then youre either fucking stupid or part of a clown guild, at which point you shouldnt care about loot prios much anymore anyway
All these things people enjoy crying about "I didn't get the item", "I never get to doom", "the prios are unfair", "I'm only getting one lust", "I was benched last raid", "I was put in the shitty group" are problems that are reliably fixed by being undeniably good at the game, by showing levels of dedication that noone else does, by contributing knowledge that goes beyond just your class and by being an enjoyable person to play and raid with. Be so valuable in the context of World of Warcraft raiding that noone can honestly deny it without losing their face, shine so bright that people will even stand up for you if someone is trying to dim your light. Be this player and you will automatically get what you deserve, you will never spot such a player having to ask for anything, it's a matter of course. This is how you win, this is how you get what you want, by being the ultimate player, and not by being a whiny little bitch.
Actually thats presicely how it works for boweaving
Skull or 3 haste items -> lusted casts are below 1.5s -> you get 5 out of bowiz proc instead of 4, pretty big deal
This guy fucks
Wrong, you dont need quags, its for lust+drums+skull, or you can have it be 3 haste items instead of skull, then the cast time for the proc is below 1.5s meaning 5 bolts will benefit from bowiz proc, this can be replicated very reliably
You dont need a bunch of stars to allign if you do it via skull you can just weave it out after skull is done and in 80+% of cases you will have had your proc
This guy did it
The sim literally proves the concept of >1.5 casttime, and I laid that out yesterday, dont know how @Louki is asking ignorant questions about it now
If you're not boweaving with enough haste and no P3 weapon you're missing out on up to 400 peak peak dps
And quite some dps on average
Its funny how "warlock trainers" were so eager to point out immolate being worth with shit gear but they are entirely ignorant about boweaving with certain gear, even though its a better increase on average than immolate ever was
this is just simming those two belts against each other nothing else changed, obviously proving the significant jump caused by <1.5 cast time, which can be achieved either by static haste (bracers+belt+1 ring) or by activating skull
@Louki tell me more about wasted taps when most fight looks exactly like this
this is bowiz in a 20 second sim, and people say you need stars to allign lol, and the uptime is more than that since the sim will clip off procs that happen before 20s but last until afterwards
currently I get 1.519 cast time with bowiz proc when lust+drums active, wearing haste bracers and 1 ring
thats 5 out of 11 casts for that 20 second timeframe that get affected by bowiz, so 5 casts gain 280 haste, which means on average those 11 casts gained 127 haste and you get that about 85% of the time if you swap out bowiz after 20 seconds always, so its 108 haste, which is a lot more than the cost of opportunity for not wearing mageblade (44 spell, 25 crit diff) or leviathan even
bowiz is just quags but with higher proc chance and the possbility to cut the icd short
yet people are happy to equip quags and ignore boweaving
I get 1.497 cast speed with haste bracers+ring+belt, so that should work out no problem
then you dont need to pay attention to skull buff, but if you lack those items skull works aswell and you can just always tap when it ran out
its 5 bolts instead of 4 bolts with haste bracers, ring and belt, wearing those items means the cast time will be 1.498 when the proc happens during lust and drums, you dont need a quag's proc at all, assuming you ALWAYS swap out bowiz after 20 seconds with a dps neutral tap its on average a 108 haste gain for that period
and by the way, this is precisely the period youre most likely to have a ring proc or destro pot active, so this 108 haste on average is more valuable than your everyday 108 haste
I performed boweaving for like 2 full t5 raids what are you talking about, stop being ignorant
and why would I clear the spell queue?
seriously stop talking out of your ass if you neither ever gave boweaving an actual shot in terms of mechanically performing it nor put any effort into understanding the concept
its only for the case of not having a p3 weapon, I guess many will have one by ZA
It doesnt have to be tapping it could also be a curse or soul shatter, any gcd you would perform anyway
and on many fights right now it would make no difference if you first doom and then set agony, or first agony and then doom, so you could first set agony and then perform the weaving with doom cast
im not doing it because of the 1.5s cast time thing which I lack the items for idiot
I did it towards the end of P2 for 2 full T5 clears and I liked it, I stopped with P2.5 because that phase sucked out my motivation for the game
boomkin can also revive people or apply the superior motw buff if you dont have a resto druid, you can also see him as a druid-reserve-slot that you switch up if feral or resto druid is missing for a raid, I think they are reasonable to bring in the context of a non giga min max guild
if youre like not posting the actual log, yet again baseless discrediting, its very possible I had to move or some other boss mechanic happened that got me off course
@Louki here on vashj extremely efficient boweave just before she died, like honestly why even bother if all you can do is baseless discrediting https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Pg7Lr2tzavTRpdQD#fight=39&type=casts&source=8&view=events&phase=3
wrong
your warlock trainer couldnt even comprehend that you get below 1.5sec cast time without quags
When the boss is almost dead theres no reason to swap it out again thats the whole point, still not understanding the concept
baseless discrediting happening again, the evidence is all over this channel
how much more often do you want to cry about banning me? maybe kids that cry for bans all the time should be banned
what misinformation? boweaving is worth it in certian scenarios and it cant be denied
I can do it correclty and Ive been doing it correctly https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/pnyQb79wAdvKz3FX#fight=7&type=damage-done
no because I dont give a shit what you think on it, I know what I did and thats what I need to know, boweaving is especially effective when you have certain movement happening like boss mechanics (moving around at alar) because then you dont have to ask yourself about the gcd being wasted or not

Hannu what is it called, TLC smuggling?
@Hannu @Louki just what is it that youre hiding about winterchill https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/gpq1Tbc7DG6NHvhA#fight=9&type=summary&source=7
you used TLC on winterchill like Hannu and I want to know the secret
but how else did you deal so little dmg with 71% crit?
like legit non bm question, you had double lust, reasonably short fight and no frost thingy, how is it possible
wait I thought I was the highs chaser here
he just couldnt stop going... 3.3k dps... surely the heal will come any second
zephans guide on skull is great, I mean I didnt read it but I looked at the formatting for 2 seconds and it looked reasonable, but ngl if a guild cant put together skull distribution without looking at a guide, Im not sure how they are figuring out killing illidan in the first place either
no its a brilliant idea, things that get people worked up is amazing for clicks

are rocket boots ON AVERAGE a net positive move on archi? (to get back faster after knockup)
warlock is like playing poker, you just take the best odds you can find and run with it
guys
guys
I think my rear mirror is buggy?
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/BzVm4NYfDLKFqZG6/#fight=last&type=damage-done
where did you go?
guys
please
I miss you
come closer to my rear mirror
I mean we are only 23 people because a storm is raging through our area
but it was enough https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/BzVm4NYfDLKFqZG6#fight=last&type=damage-done
I had rocket boots, enough for everyone
I will say 1 thing
I told them
give the 2nd extra one to the hunters
it wasnt my decision
but we were 23 people only and they dont trust the hunters
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/BzVm4NYfDLKFqZG6#fight=last&type=damage-done
and I didnt play optimally
anyway
spellpenners are 🤡
?
I had 3 lusts
and tbf
23 players is aids
also
our shadow priest got a 99 even though he tried to pull this off optimally
we are missing the resto druid to innervate arcane mage which is raiddps too
we arent doing this intentionally but because storm raped 2 people
just demand earth shield ez
I had a lust in phase 2 tonight and it wasnt an issue, idk how other locks kill themselves
I took nightmare seed though
but never dipped into scary area
?
its so easy to disprove spellpen theory
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/yrm672FPjangv4wN#fight=40&type=damage-done&source=33
this guy only had 5.2k average shadow bolt dmg
I had 5.7k average shadow bolt dmg
he doesnt have 4p but its only 6% and thats way more diff than 6%
what
I had the higher average shadow bolt cast so I outplayed him by switching
I mean you can do what you want but if presented the choice I'll go with winning
its not ridiculous but literally how it works, if you took the average shadow bolt dmg out of all spellpeeners and all switchers youd have the actual answer
I mean yeah bring it on
noobs
its funny how starboard post (btw starboard is bypassing me having blocked that useless person) fails to mention how my raid only consisted of 23 players + spreads lie that it was my doing that I got 3rd lust
you got played by a raid with 23 players
imagine
no we failed to kill illidan
also people said blah blah really stupid for the shadow... well the shadow parsed a 99 with 0 lusts and a really shitty killtime, seems to be very non benefitial for shadows to do that

I dont do things like insurance, not paying for insurance and also not crashing is the optimal play
!stars @Mayhem
wait, how am I in shag's rear mirror

Since this spellpen shit 15 years older
Age doesnt exist, its just some arbitrary number humans decided to introduce based on rotations around the sun, but it could be anything like number of times someone has taken a shit
It wouldnt go faster or slower because that statement is relative to earth ages which dont exist
The age number should be tied to events that actually make you age, like messages read in this discord
U wanna know what a real clown fiesta looks like? Ok: today on kaz'rogal our hunter, lets call him hunter 1, bombed the raid by letting mark oom him. This in itself was bad enough, but hunter 2 barely survived that attack and thought to himself "shit, Im ooming too, better pop a dark rune" with which he killed himself, solving the oom problem and not bombing the raid like hunter 1 did.
Even our slug warlock got 4p already
And the other one is at 2/4 with skull
The aff has nothing though and today during the raid his PC caught fire
Spellpen on council is garbage and cringe, real gamers just play the mechanics
Running spell pen on council instead of playing is undeniably
Which one?
How many had 23 players in the raid?
I would rather have 2 lusts and a proper raid than 3 and this trainwreck, also I didnt even want the 3rd lust, it was forced on me because they wanted to kill the boss
Then the ideal play is to tell them to not kite the mage
No I played it badly
I wasnt very fit anymore because of 4h raid no break and I didnt go for the healthy walk beforehand
No I didnt I told them to give it to melees or hunters but they preferred this
The raid had 23 players only and they wanted to go with what they were most confident with
Also imo it has to be acknowledged the dmg our SP dealt
With 0 lust
No 2 players had Stromausfall
I also had 90 minutes of power outage in the afternoon
It was a very real 90 minutes
But we gaming again
Which is absolutely reasonable
If everyone goes yolo mode boss is dead before too many ports can happen
So once every 2 years, see you in wrath
Reviving 1 person every 4th raid > everyone always cucked
Yes hence the yuge 100
Louki must be fun at parties
I dont go to parties
No its only loser if it wasn't my choice
Hes right though items are multiplicative
You pick up the item -> you deal more dps -> raid deals more dps -> increase of personal dps
Ele shaman should be stacked with SR, SP too
And have soulstone
Wait no soulstone is on me
Mages are pretty out prob but they got blink
It does in terms of saving mage life but kinda kills everyone else chained cos mage isnt moving
certain mobs exist which you can oneshot with a crit, if you have enough spell, this could be a consideration
also 3/3 soul leech important
are you on a pvp server?
pve gear is better for ganking situations
if you wear t6 noone is ganking you out of respect
if you make a name for yourself, noone is ganking you, its like how irl the popular kid at school isnt getting bullied even when physically inferior
even if the alliance is our enemy, enemies become friends when theres a greater enemy, maybe russia and nato dont like each other now, but they sure as hell would if aliens appeared to attack the planet, this is what happens when alliance sees me "hes fighting for us on the global leaderboard, Im not going to hold him back by ganking him"
Wow I can't believe you all spend billions of dollars trying to defend your country. I spent 5 million and got sick of it. It's 24 aircraft carriers, it won't change anything. A single nuke on a metropolis will do more damage... cyber warfare is coming, not wasting my time on this.
Guys with all these custom pastas about me my ego is getting too big, it has already become so massive I noticed a shadow priest orbiting around me when I woke up today
It's amazing how the concept of raid support in TBC translates to real life, behind every great man there has been an even greater woman supporting him, and it works both ways. When my girlfriend gets burnt out I put down that emotional manatide for her and when I have a mental breakdown she performs that tranquilizing shot for me. It doesn't even have to be love, it could be any kind of support. A rogue on his own is a lost child with no means of reaching anything. If you find yourself in trouble, look for others and enhance each other. No one man army is stronger than a synergetic collective. Join a club, make some friends and get those real life windfury procs going ❤️

wipe 4- multiple phyical dps pull aggro on council
wipe 5- flame gets tanked in the raid group
wipe 6 -mage pulls aggro on flame, wiping the raid group
wipe 7 - melee pulls aggro on a flame, flame wipes raid group
wipe 8 - flame tank dies due to too little healing received
if our guild was a parse guild we would wait on lusts which we dont as proven by archimonde and supremus log
but then u can block no?
well this he didnt do but ngl I wouldnt do it either if Im losing dps for a 2/25 chance of something bad happening, possibly
the first thing I said about my council parse was that I played it poorly, stop creating false narratives
I used the council parses to strengthen my argument on how to play the boss and I thought the SP parsing a 99 with 0 lusts was the more interesting aspect of that log, because a big part of what spellpen shillers have been saying "the SP cant do it, youll have shit weaving uptime"
if people have only 1 message per day the channel will be full of "fuck mages"
Im not sure in an optimal world the potential of mage swap is the highest, and the spell bubbles dont occur too often and often when youre on the paladin anyway, and its only worth if all casters are wearing spellpen, not just you, the one chadlock, and I dont see all of our casters getting spellpen ever when we're already killing the boss confidently
maybe? but we're not, and mage swap has the highest highs so even a parse guild should consider it
the point of mage kiting is so that your gdkp consisting of 5 carries and 20 buyers can kill the boss

I thought the whole post in research about it was a bit like psychology studies
a lot of rambling just to get to the same solution as common sense
when it was talked about I took my bowiz, procced it on a basilisk and noticed that indeed the haste buff is not speeding up the gcd
it took less than a minute and that guy was writing weak auras on ptr
but ok I respect the scientific thingy about it
this is the price you pay for being a "sEriOuS gUilD" and its called fun in a video game https://discord.com/channels/253210018697052162/823471727081422849/943093425878736927
I had to block multiple persons because blocking scales really well with blocking even more, if you block just one person you will know who the author of blocked messages is making the block not as effective, by blocking multiple I cannt know who it is, if I block enough persons Ill also stop missing the context of visible messages because there will be none
we had 4 wipes and all of those were in phase 2 so we didnt even get to that part, we would have had enough dps for the skip though easily
anyone tell me more about how rushing 4p is making me a greedy loot funnel
https://clips.twitch.tv/RenownedTsundereBubbleteaOptimizePrime-plLPKWSNq7--GuuY
but maybe you are just a casual guild having fun on the weekend, then just toss it out
I dont even have much, some weeks from now theyll vendor the T6 tokens, everyone knows it, its not a smart play if youre actually greedy, the other warlock ended up getting skull, its a bad trade in the great picture and I didnt ask for it, but Im fine with it, the actually greedy people act like theyre the holy light themselves passing on T6 or any other item really so they can grab skull (Im not saying that this is what the other warlock did, but this is how many think)
wasnt Nizhny Novgorod called Gorkiy back then tho?
countries just shouldnt be a thing, mostly
what the fuck
so this one chinese guy was absolutely destroying it all
then he put on a pathetic show in mount hyjal for whatever reason

Its like someone pulls a switch and this chat goes full retard all of a sudden

I love it
@Louki soon our disagreement on the council thing will be resolved, because you are smart and I am right
Nothing personal kid, you were just an easy target
spam the starboard
Every 5th star will be donated to the shadow warlocks raiding without a shadow priest foundation
why is it that every time i open this discord, it's always u bonobos talking about some degen shit
@Dive is in my rear mirror so its all good
When people try to farm stars with the same old pastas I call that
Why the fuck does it say gemming wizard
Everyone does, even themselves
Only boomers display group frames in a raid
Don't let the cult mislead you my son, wear no spellpen and swap to the mage, and it will be good

Wtf its 9 years old
Wtf hes 22 now

We will all make it brah
Spellpen is bad
Spellpen no fun
Its a lot more fulfilling to get a gameplay solution right than a cookie cutter one
And the point of the game is to have fun, not getting cucked
If I wanted to get cucked Id be playing survival hunter, not warlock
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/btqDM7ByTQzVr2wv#fight=30&type=auras&source=27
2 innervate 1 pi
make it illegal
yeah
3 arcane mages on kazrogal, 3 innervates available
lets give them to the warlock
this is so dumb
had my guild killed illidan id have claimed #1 spot at least for a couple days
now youre up against this shit
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1011#boss=619
I came in to save the warlocks
mages are so past their prime and out of the game its unreal
must feel depressing to play
its like they went for soft tires in a race where you cant change tires
at that point the 3rd lust is literally a net negative move
had it been in another group the kill time wouldnt have been that atrocious
he only used like half of it
the first 4k dps log will be from a warlock, mages are donezo
mages started out with their football team consisting only of older players that were in the fourth inning of their prime
we started out with a balanced team
Sir, this is a Wendy's
You get gaps either way
It really lowers your potential
Casts + timeline
You don't have to sim everything or always obey what the sim says. Sims are just indicators for feels- and resultcraft which are the most optimal ways of making decisions. If something feels bad then fuck that, I'm not doing it. I'm playing the game for fun and not to be correct "theoretically". What matters to me is that I'm happy with my results and that I have fun producing them. For this very reason I use destro pot over mana pot, it feels a lot stronger, it's more fun and the results don't make me question it. No mana pot user has my results, my results are amazing. I don't care what the sims say unless it's a massive difference. Don't overthink these tiny differences and play the game. You'll only hold yourself back and get distracted from too much theorycraft. Get the basics right and just pump, it's that easy.
I think its some type of gender
Many bad boomers exist that dont balance their threat on both flames its basically why we didnt kill him last raid, apart from being 23 people only
Thats great for you
Doesnt work with our tanks
Or if you actually deal dmg
Druids
It would have been ok without braindead mage and hunter that focus 1 only and pull aggro
Yeah it was his first fd too
He used fd after taking 1 hit from it, then it went rampage on the melees
It wasnt even at the start
There were 5 healers only (who also fucked up) maybe thats why so conservative
Even then, it was ok for me by spreading my aggro, and these dps just went full braindead
I did the math I wouldve been rank 1 for one day, now already some chinese innervate guy exists, feel kinda robbed but w/e
We dont have someone to tank the boss apart from the pally
I will be happy if we some way kill the boss on monday, 2 idiots not signed up yet
One of them salty because he got flamed for pulling aggro on council, also he bombed us for 100k+ friendly fire on kaz
The other one claimed to have power outage during the raid, now im suspecting since he didnt get a bt id hes thinking of going gdkp instead of just illdian with us.. is a trial

𝓦𝓮'𝓻𝓮 𝓪𝓵𝓵 𝓰𝓸𝓷𝓷𝓪 𝓶𝓪𝓴𝓮 𝓲𝓽 𝓫𝓻𝓪𝓱 ~Aziz Shavershian
Innervate should legit be banned though as long as mage exists in raid
no
im the lust swapper, I just drag one person over the other and they switch idk what the problem is just use standard interface ezpz
the argument I see for weakauras and shit if you want a specific set of players to be affected
you can min max the lusting by a lot doing that
like our warlock lust goes to 3x warlock and then either ele or boomkin, but it could also be 3x warlock and an arcane mage or something
we had for each boss predefined which players get lust at which point in time in the boss fight, optimizing for specs, cooldowns etc
shadows, boomkin, healer, they never saw a single lust ever
yeah we crafted macros for the swaps that sent a message to a character outside the instance
that char had assist and performed the swap automatically depending on the message
I see in logs a lot of people they do 2nd lust but then they do it really dumb
like directly after the 1st one even though its a boss thats gonna live way longer than 2:30 or so
the 2nd lust should go into 2 min cds
if the boss lives long enough
hunters yet to peak
hunter with thoridal u gonna shit urself
but I think for most fights BW isnt up a 2nd time so warlocks better 2nd lust receivers
no, and its not gonna hold anyone back except for time losses when you do stupid things
sunwell is about the bossfights really
unless ur like uber speedrunning then ofc it will be about the trash portion too
this is what you need in life
he can have our hunters and we'll take theirs
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Mhvn42VycW6xagqY#boss=-3&difficulty=0&type=damage-done
mages are so out its funny, in sunwell they will be crying, the bossfights will be longer there with steady pumping they cant handle it, even if they go fire, a fire mage is just an inferior version of a warlock, mages are sinking like the titanic with their degen discord still playing music, theyre completely donezo
why would you put resources into mages tho
they dont have a lot to gain left
people will bring 1 for arcane intellect thats it
but I guess scrolls exist
damn I need to start hoarding those scrolls
When you arrive at a car crash site, you see two perons literally dying, you can only save the life of one, who you help? The mage (73 y/o) or the warlock (24 y/o)?
You're the US army (guild leadership): You've been told that a civil aircraft consisting mostly of mages has been hijacked by a group of terrorists (mage discord) and they're steering the airplane towards a full house football stadium (your raid success), what do you do? Shoot down the airplane (which is going to crash either way) or nothing?
Bonus question: You receive a call from passengers of the airplane itself, they beg you to not shoot down the airplane, you hear voices screaming and crying in the background, you hear prayers and last second confessions of love, does that affect your choice?
I'm like the sexually abusive boyfriend, they'd love to break up with me but they depend on me and in some moments they'd even miss me
well tbh it is, but that sort of reinforces the analogy
but bias is good not bad
dkp enables dickheads because the system is unbiased
and enables bad players unless they have extra points for being good or something
and since dkp enables dickheads, you mostly have dickheads flocking to dkp guilds
meaning theyre pretty cancer usually
the only people who dont like loot council are the people that are shit at the game, dont provide as much values as others and display shitty attitude, so they end up getting less loot
at the point where you attach 1000 rules to those systems to fix their flaws youre basically running a loot council anyway
your proposed systems are for bad players that cant handle getting less when they deserve less
the only people Ive seen unhappy with loot council decisions in recent years have been the absolute worst players in the raid, in terms of playing, attending and being a enjoyable person to play with, which honestly there is a merit to this being a factor too
I have been offered to join the loot council of my guilds like 3 times now and I always denied the offer, even though I really like getting the items, just how come?
a shit ton of politics happens on a very basic communal level, like a lot more politics happens on that level actually than anywhere else, and in many places you dont get paid shit for that, yet people do it, just how come?
contrary to popular belief, and coincidentally what media is trying to tell you, the world is getting better day by day and people are getting better and gaming is getting more mature, lootcouncil is like a lot better today than it was 15 years ago, its not the same anymore, because people change to the better, believe it or not
its not just the councils themselves making better decisions, but also people outside the council having a more realistic look on the decisions, handling it better when they dont get the item
at this point if you have someone actively looking for a guild with a point based loot system, its a huge red flag, they couldnt handle lootcouncil guilds, they were delusional about their value for the guild, problematic people to have in the raid, now they look for a system they can selfishly abuse
actually since heals department from the board of directors of the circus, 3b can have a trial run, congratz
when I was in that shitty guild for a few weeks at the end of p1/start p2, they literally DE'd best in slot items because retards were saving up for dst
Spellpeners on council basically brought a shotgun to a balloon shooting stand. They were able to hit quite some balloons the first time round, but didnt manage to improve a lot in further attempts. Meanwhile mage swappers went for the semi auto rifle, at first they didnt hit a lot of balloons because it was harder to operate, but after some practice they ended up shooting more balloons than the shotgun using spellpeners. Pew pew pew. Just like that
all top parses are shadow (actually not all top parses are shadow some chinese still run fire) because nobody is playing fire anymore
its just the same like no top parses were shadow in p1, not because it was bad, but because noone was playing it
wait
this is the same guy that just argued in favor of spell pen because of muh "consistency" lmao
now hes advocating for 3 cleave
the brain twists people are willing to perform if you are stubborn on an idea are unreal
no its not, its you applying certain standards only if it fits your narrative
im not proven wrong lmao
considering that Im like 1v9 on this thing, its more like Im proving to be right more than anything
you dont need to run a sim to understand that dealing 100% of the damage is better than dealing 95% of the damage
jow loses some relevance because of tapping occuring while running out of aoe anyway
without the movement considered, I think its 1 tap or less difference
youre still on the paladin half the time
I have seen the shadow bolt numbers as per the logs, and they are very pathetic on the spell pen part
I would rather give skull to a really bad warlock than to a good mage, because theres still a chance the warlock's account gets hacked and someone better ends up playing it
there is no downside to bringing enough shards and only upside to shadowburning, so anything other than bringing enough shards and shadowburning every little thing you can is griefing
Ryu is a mage swapper, brilliant minds think alike
damage dealers dealing damage indeed valuable
I deal about 250k damage with shadowburn in a bt run when I brought enough shards, which everyone should, thats 1 million damage for 4 warlocks which is not something to laugh at, and now apply the same way of "thinking" to everyone else in the raid using finisher moves like mage flame blast or ele shocks, its a fair amount of damage in total, Id say at least 2% of the raid's total damage actually, also mobs living awkwardly long is very weird and annoying, you can just run 2 28 slot soul bags, I do it, not an issue, if you dont like it you can put them into the bank after the raid, Ive made it a habit to start raids with both bags filled plus some. Its a good habit to have and it also helps me mentally to be bringing this many soul shards to the raid because running low on shards feels very bad, its an actual horror to be honest. Having to say "Im out of shards" or even imply that youre low on shards is very embarrassing, this affects the performance I can display in the raid aswell. It also affects the performance of everyone else too. Its a lot better feeling to be raiding for everyone involved knowing the warlocks are bringing so many soul shards they cant possibly run low. Its just that feeling of confidence and empowerment you get knowing youre raiding with competent warlocks. Its an aspect many overlook. My best shadowburns deal almost 6k damages, its a significant amount of damage, many shadow bolts end up dealing less damage than that, even crits sometimes. Also this way youre making sure all isb stacks are getting used up before the mob dies which feels very nice. I always hate it to see those precious stacks go to waste. Seeing that a lot less by shadowburning helps my mental. Also helps the mental of everyone in the raid seeing the stacks used up efficiently. Again its a nice thing to have in the raid, warlocks which are confident. Just makes you feel better about the raid and you play better. I for one am pro shadowburning whenever its a dps gain.
because you have shit locks, how about you get *real* locks
which class has the higher dps on anetheron, the releast of dps bosses? its warlock, not mages
mages tried quadruple innervate and triple pi and it didnt work, not even close
you cant compete with a *real* warlock
they are not Im above them, just havent killed illidan yet this lockout
If I get an illidan kill in which I like, dont die, Im world 2 or 3 or something
mages cant even compete on a burst boss anymore
theyre out
bye bye
hasta la vista

tschüss

mages brought a drag racing car to a 24 hour race, their car just ran out of fuel and now they all have to squeeze into a 🤡 🚙  its amazing actually how many gnome mages you can fit into just one 🤡 🚙
tell me how much more dps improvement youre going to get from p3 items
oh wait its basically nothing
🤡 
(just pre-clowning your next wall o' mald because Im afk for a sec)
even if his sim was correct, not even 3k dps what pathetic outlook is that 🤡
quote me on this little mage shitter @Jujutsu I will personally break 4k dps on a single target boss before even a single 🤡 mage in all of world of warcraft does
if you think in terms of "value" and healers also dpsing whenever they can, warlocks having the 20% extra healing adds a lot of dps to the raid indirectly, also they are more stable with not having some pathetic ass life pool, just the better class to bring at this point, for any type of guild really, unless its a clown themed one
have you adjusted for cost of opportunity of your innervate for raid dps? because it could go elsewhere? like warlock?
it will be so funny in the sunwell plateau
locks are ok, hunters strong too, but mages, mages theyre neither good nor bad, theyre simply not in the raid :peepohappy:
they needed to break with their "nO cHanGeS" policiy with paladins just to make alliance even remotely viable 🤡
still not having killed illidan in the current lockout, lol
Im beating that overall dps giga easily already lol https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Mhvn42VycW6xagqY#boss=-3&difficulty=0&type=damage-done
I can still heat it up no problem, this is just the warmup lap
if you adjust for warlock seed dmg %, your raid and my raid, youre getting your ass slapped lmfao
I get to have 25% seed dmg because my guild is degen, your warlocks get to have 38% seed dmg because its not as degen, so had I been in your raid I would have eaten your lunch bigly, with making you look at me eating it and shit
heals farms himself mostly
this is heals when he links one of his parses


this is zephan, hes nice and all but not even racing, but taking care of everyone crashing
missing 30 dps is like having forgotten to take your bufffood, and you always feel bad when you dont have your food buff, so why wouldnt you feel bad about wielding the inferior weapon?
The skillcap in this game isnt very high, there are no big things you could be doing suboptimally, if you want to make an actual difference and stand out you have to gather ever tiny little advantage you can find and all of those things others may not be doing added together will end up making a noticable difference. Thats your only shot, there is no one magic trick. Take for example having the ele as your girlfriend for optimal totem placements, lust timings and general synergy. Are others doing that? No, probably not. Why are you not doing it? It can be an advantage.
Tent is only for the 3 current circus directors which are right now hannu, xelrog and 3b

I thought this would get your logs invalidated?

on mother they legit waited for lust after first wiping
is it some kind of player-economy thing? like how you can buy items in gdkp they let you buy a parserun for yourself?
Do they have their own warcraftlogs and we are only seeing a fraction of whats actually going on there?

You dont wear spellpen on council to "parse", you wear it to dumb down the encounter, to decrease the burden of execution on the player and to increase consistency of result. It's not for "parsing", which is something different. Since the question has been answered incorreclty, I deemed the answer as clown. The correction of this has happened only after the verdict.
winterchill - no free taps (1)
anetheron - no free taps unless an infernal spawns literally inside your butthole (2)
kazrogal - no free taps, actually more taps than normal (3)
azgalor - free taps only when running out of rain for fire which is a bit yolo, also its not enough to satisfy mana thirst (3.5)
archimonde - free taps only for a 1/5 chance you get knocked to bagdad, and if you get chased by fire, will still often have to use forced taps (4)
najentus - no free taps (no you delaying the raid by tapping while shield is up are not free taps) (5)
supremus - free taps exist later, but if you start with a lust you have to use forced taps, though usually its on cd from najentus (5)
akama - oom soon at seeding, have to tap, free taps for the transition (5.5)
ros - need to use forced taps in phase 2 (6)
gurtogg - taps are only half free because the movement required is a lot shorter than the tap (6.5)
mother - no free taps, only maybe if healthy after getting ported, low chance (7.5)
council - barely any free taps, tapping when moving out of aoe dangerous, doesnt happen that much anyway (8.5)
illidan - need to tap in p2 and at the start of p4 (9)

9 out of 14 encounters are turret style, if you look at the actual logs, not that many free taps are occurring in t6 and therefore if you could sim one thing only, it should be turret style and not infinite mana
Im trying to hit shadow bolt travel time breakpoint for an extra shadow bolt, since theres a chance I wont be in rain of fire in 10 yard range, its the optimal play for peak output
having a shadow priest or not is most likely not gonna make or break your parsing because noone with a brain has a shadow priest in the warlock group, only if something went wrong bigly with the setup, but the kind of raid where that happens is usually not competition for parsing anyway, if you bring 2 shadow priests that means not only are you losing some isb stacks, but also that slot could be filled with a 3rd warlock providing more raiddps (and isb stacks), so Id rather bring 1 shadow priest only and not having it in the arcane mage group is gonna be a noticable difference for raiddps, maybe having a shadow priest in your group or getting innervate is the optimal play for your personal parse, but for my taste its too little of a difference and too degen to be considered
well yes, unfortunately it requires brain power from players in the raid that are not you, so its a bit out of your control
like if it confuses someone even for a second its already not worth
for this reason under a specific fight length its worth to run rocket boots and speed to the boss for your last couple shadow bolts
on Loatheb I like to run rocket boots aswell because it allows you to cut a lot of walking downtime from running to the spore, and neither the hit nor the crit are a loss on that boss
?
he should make the priest respec then
Does the thing still work where you have the priest buff you and then respec and the buffs wont be dispelled?
rewarding healer parses is asking for a shitty raid
its just a game of resources really, if you min/max healing by cutting as many healers as you can, that means avoiding taking damage is translating into damage dealt, because playing with a brain enables extra dps slots and then you add on top of that healers can be dpsing whenever they dont have to cast a heal, its why bringing 2 sp is less of a meme than many think it is, because if you dont think in terms of raw dps but in terms of interconnected values, which ultimately result into dps and raid speed, then shadow priests are actually very valuable, they decrease the mana factor/enable more dps in those groups and vampiric embrace can actually heal a pretty relevant amount if you let it do it, like healers could be deciding not to heal someone at 50% if they precisely know that the player cant possibly take lethal damage anytime soon, vampiric embrace will do the job and the healers can dps instead
One day you'll get it pal, because you are smart and I am right
height is cool and all but its the inner greatness that matters
old busses and trains tend to be a lot more convenient and cozy than new ones
modern public transport is too min/max and comfort for the common man not enough of an aspect
well, not ideal
you should plan for yourself this group and get innervates
If it was a simulation then it would be better for raid dps if the ele wore 2p t4, good eles can push to 2k dps and beyond but that still doesnt change the fact that this is mathematically the correct choice. But we don't raid in a simulation, we raid with human beings and letting our other human beings in the raid have some fun too is going to cause them to play better and its gonna be an overall better result, so they should be allowed to wear their 4p t6.
this is not about being nice to the ele, when you say this to the ele you still drop as a side note what would be efficient for the raid in the simulation, and then what they will do is actually wear the 2p t4 by themselves, because they want to be admired by the great warlocks, and they will be happy doing so because they think it was their choice to do so
if you want someone to make a sacrifice for the greater good, the best way to go about it is always to trick them into thinking they made that choice on their own
who is the queen of this colony? because you guys look like ants back there

If youre the top dog, team order will fix it for you
does anyone know what its actually saying? I imagine this is what reading my messages feels like
its better to just use corruption at the start not this shit

!mcdonalds
imagine you spend years, decades even to build forum sperg reputation and then they just remove it
legit though the game being this ez ruins it
leather?
so this is what a clown looks like from the back
the thing is, you only wipe because of bullshit, because someone fucks up in a pathetic way, you dont have wipes that are like "fair game, the boss was stronger and we'll figure out a way to beat him" its only horseshit thats wiping you, the efforts of the raid in general dont matter for killing the boss
if its just 1 person wearing spell penis how is it ever going to be worth?
its not tryhard
its cookie cutter braindead
not tryhard
if you try hard try perfecting mage swap
what do you think feels better, high parses with mage swap or high parses with c🤡 🤡 kie cutter approach?
use corruption on pull
@bbq / tl419 man I thought you'd at least put up a fight, passed you as if you were a granny on the highway
nobody needs immolate, everybody needs cataclysm, there is no need for balance, its clear
I literally dont have a keybinding for immo
I parsed a 100 on mother without giving the slighest fuck about "immo is technically good here!!!1"
just cut immo out of your warlock gameplay like you would cut an old toxic friend out of your life, you neither need it nor does it help you, its just a distraction from the actual tasks at hand
how the fuck is heals so close up in my rear mirror? oh wait I just lapped him the 2nd time  😂
It's not a question which belt is better, even if they were simming equally, Anetheron's Noose is providing isb uptime support for other shadows which means increased raid dps which means increased personal dps. And honestly the type of person that is willing to run their own sims will typically run epic gems, so this is not a question. Even if the answers are clear, the difference is marginal and people should just take any belt thats available. Personally, with ZD I'd lean towards noose and with ToC towards waistwrap. Though a lock running the latter should be compensated in other areas of gearing like dick size.
Its 4 lockouts so far
I think for burgerland the 5th started today
More haste means less isb because you make it go down faster
Saving the inventory space spellpen gear requires and bringing more shards for more reckless shadowburning will literally deal more damage in a raid
Should ask rank 1439 world, lord of spellpen
Its funny how rank 1439 world has higher parses on low execution bosses only and happens to be a spellpen shill simultaneously
Guys I found Heals racing to the top with his guild
spellpen is only a legitimate approach if all casters are doing it and not just 1 or 2, otherwise its strictly worse and all it does is reduce the amount of aoe for boomers to afk in, if boomers afking is not an issue and youre shilling spellpen while not all casters are on board on it, youre actually griefing the whole raid in favor of what you think is best for your personal parse, and even if you get everyone to do it, its still worse than just swapping to the mage lol
my warlock is just my enchanting alt and ur losing to it, lol
if ur getting baited by rank 1439 world its kinda pathetic tbh, its like when you throw a bunch of dirt into the water and the fish flock to it thinking its food
ur probably gonna die of old age if you start scrolling down the pages in search of it
man idk the guy was so irrelevant his rank number was easier to remember than the actual name
wtf
my gf (ele) just won ZD in a pug rolling a 100 on it
in the other pug she completed her 4p
gonna be blasting
❤️
rank 1 dps venoxis (not just warlock)

CL 500
speed
does shaman t3 4p setbonus work like t4 2p setbonus (affects the totem itself + snapshots)?
bruh seems like first I got some questing to do
they managed a teron wipe
so they didnt clear
jaedenar is the worst place in all of wow, I literally start feeling claustrophobic whenever I enter it, I hope this is where they keep all the blue parsing warlocks
whats the best way to go about killing bank characters in thunderbluff with the infernal? how do I get them pvp flagged? can an infernal kill the auctioneers? or lets say I team up with a warlock doomsquad lets say 20 people and we unleash infernals to the auctioneers, will that kill them?
anyone know louki bank character name?
if your raid is struggling with dps for p3, fire eles will take long enough for trinkets to be back up
russia economy is dogshit and sanctions work
The Ukraine has 4 nuclear power plants, nuclear energy still feel so great?
running nuclear power is like a tank choosing to wear an item with slightly better stats that puts him to 99.9% crit immunity
nuclear great idea in concept, not so great idea when plant gets bombed or vis maior occurs
"Ukraine fighting rages in Chernobyl near nuclear facility: official"
aged like milk lmao
kicked some more mage ass on najentus 
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1011#boss=601
balanced setup is automatically decent for parsing whereas speedrunning u stack classes like normally you wouldnt so its logistically 10 times the effort because now it also requires splits to get everyone geared
look at the gap between high 99 and low 99 its so damn easy to parse 99 right now you could probably do it consistently even with 0 lusts 
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/xAhjkd123NBfmnVQ#type=damage-done&fight=8
and on council the bar for 99 is even lower because all the boomers are fumbling bigly with the aoe around them regardless of how theyre actually playing the boss
tanks dead
we have 3 out of 4 warlocks with 4p t6, even if this discord likes to portray it differently, I took the shitty end of loot because all the actually relevant pieces have gone past me
you think I have to ASK for it? 🤡
there is no support or carry, its a game of fluent, interconnected values, some "support" classes providing more of those than the uninformed thinks or even the more informed manages to make use of, its a different game if you really put all of the values to work, but this content is not demanding enough for it
bad tool if in the wrong hands, for example many stupid leaders dont realize the mana pot vs destro pot situation for warlock
there is a crapton of reason to pop mana pot all over the raid, guess what kiddo, trash exists and Im not gonna pop a destro pot seeding on trash
the tool which we're talking about shows overall uses idiot, so yes you are talking about trash too
its about leaders working with the tool not parses
they dont need a tool to look at parses
im just being real
bad warlock can chug 40 destros in a raid when he uses them on cd and to an ignorant/uninformed leader it will look like hes giga pumping next to the warlock that uses destro on bosspull only
wrong, you have free taps just before the shield comes up as proven by current rank 1 world on najentus
shield explosion is 8.5k damage into a 14.5k nightmare seeded lifepool, you only need to be at like 59% hp to survive as a warlock, and healers know youre lifetapping just before the shield comes up so they can precast or prehot, and its not like you should be completely ending yourself, 2-3 taps in place of a shadow bolt that would otherwise probably hit the shield and do nothing, its more or less free taps, if your guild has good dps you only need 1 more tap afterwards
alright finally got this dumbass naxx trinket, so which fights is it even still good on? its simming lower for me on all fights that are in the 75 to 110 second area compared with icon and quag's, let alone skull
I think in mh Id only use it on azgalor and archi, azgalor because theres a decent chance ill be silenced during quag's proc and archi because its long enough + a lot of micro movement so not a huge fan of quags here either
the first 3 die too fast and basically 99% chance quag proc will be used effectively
if you never get 2 lusts as a warlock you should question raid setup or the decision where extra lusts go to
think Im gonna give motc a run even on shorter bosses (even though it sims worse than quags) and let resultcraft decide what I think of it
autistlock used to be mostly non clown but then he paid a bunch of gold to yoink haste cloak from healers
not cool autistlock
not cool
People buy gear to compensate for tiny peepee, just like people buy sports cars to compensate for tiny peepee, but I could run a Ford Fiesta and still win against these clows, while also having a massive peepee
While Im provided the sports car by my racing team because they trust me to win, Autistlock has to buy his sports car from a shady car dealership using the money that was meant for his child's graduation
You know what Autistlock? You can go ahead and buy your sports car from the shady dealership, its your choice. I prefer taking the high road, because its way less crowded.
