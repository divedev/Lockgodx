"Boweaving" is the terminus technicus for weaving Blade of Wizardry ("bowiz") in and out of your character's weapon slot during an encounter. Normally weapon swaps cause a global cooldown to occur, typically resulting in a loss of dps uptime if the weapon is swapped during combat. Thus it typically is inefficient to swap your weapon while you're intending to cast spells. This is not the case if the weapon swap is combined with the global cooldown of a spell eg life tap, shadowburn or soul shatter. Both actions can be performed at the same time. If you swap your weapon together with a spell that you would have used anyway, no loss of uptime can be attributed to the weapon swap. This means that you can start out fights wielding bowiz, wait for the proc to happen and then weave it out for a weapon with stronger stats, as a result - most of the time - skipping the majority of the 50 second inner cooldown that bowiz has. A successful performance of said actions is called a "boweave" and causes bowiz to be a much stronger weapon than it normally would be. After bowiz has come off the inner cooldown, another boweave can be performed for another proc. Jpaint kind of smells. The proc rate of bowiz is 15%, meaning that bowiz will proc at or before the 5th cast in more than 56% of cases. This causes boweaving to be a dps gain even in single target encounters. Here's an example. Warlock A: "How is warlock C dealing so much damage? I just can't keep up with him and I'm the one dooming!" Warlock B: "He's probably boweaving again..." Warlock A: "That must be it, I forgot that he's a master boweaver."
