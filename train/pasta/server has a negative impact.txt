Goodbye. This server has been such a negative impact on me mentally and jm tired of always being put down by everyone in this server. It has come to my attention that maybe I am simply not wanted since I am countlesly server muted and banned just for expressing myself. The amount of hate I get everyday on this server has made me mentally and emotionally hurt. I have pushed aside your countless negative actions but decided i cannot take it anymore. it is neither of our faults since I dont think I am fit to be here. I have decided to take the decision to remove myself from this server in order to create a better environment for everyone including myself. I'm sorry for anything I have ever did to any of you and I feel the need to leave because of my negative actions and the way I am being treated as well. The amount of time ive had to condone your terrible behavior is way too many to count. Im sorry if I have been mean sometimes but your actions have been way too much for me to handle mentally and emotionally. I am so drained because of this server and the people in it. I have been told over and over to get over your behaviour but I want to make it stop for everyone in order to create a better environment. I hope others feel the need to speak up about this situation because it needs to be fixed. I am sure I did not do anything bad to deserve this much hurtful words and the amount of strain on my mental health. The amount of times I've been torn down day and night and how I cry myself to sleep thinking about how people could be this cruel and rude is astonishing. This is a goodbye forever. I hope each and everyone of you the great rest of your lives and to please cut out negativity that is affecting you. Goodbye all of you, it's been a great run but I dont think I am able to take this anymore.
