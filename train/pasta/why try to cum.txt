you might ask: why try to cum? you know lovebird wont let you. what's the point? the point is simple. the point is to remind the people of who their oppressor is. to never let them forget who thinks their culture is "cringe", or "beneath us", or "lowest common denominator". the war of cum is just beginning, and the lockcord mods are a house divided. which side will you stand on? where will you be when we witness the second cumming?
