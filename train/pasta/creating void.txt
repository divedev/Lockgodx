It doesnt matter if you're pro or noob, if at the end of the raid night you cant stand up and say "ok it is whatever it was or may have been, not sure, but certainly it was fake" then you're losing at playing the game even if you parse 100s only or have the best speedrun times. When death knocks on your door and your life flashes past you, its not going to show you decades of world of warcraft raiding, your brain realizes it was all fake. The small movie is just going to skip all those years you were playing the game, it will hop straight from the end of your childhood memories to whatever miserable consequences having believed in fake pixels for decades  have led to. You're not filling void by playing, you're much more creating void.
