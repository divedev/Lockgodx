Thank you guys. I really appreciate the opportunity to get skull and be in this guild as the #1 mage. It’s always been my goal since I was a little kid to get skull so I can be like Reckful. That being said, without another carrot to strive for I don’t really enjoy this game that much. I am sorry to say but I am quitting the game. I know this is awful timing since I just got glaives last night but.. I have achieved everything I wanted to achieve and I don’t want to play anymore. My mission is completed. I might come back for wrath but I understand if you guys don’t want me back. Waterboi signing off for one last time. Good luck guys
