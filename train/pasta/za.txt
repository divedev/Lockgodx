I shouldn't have to explain this but you're all fucking stupid so I will...

 We don't have enough people in the guild to make 3 perfectly comped ZA groups. If you don't understand that you're a dumb fuck. ZA is a 10 man raid that resets on a 3 day cool down. It's easy as fuck and I promise you pugs will be getting bear mounts on the first day. It is your responsibility to make sure you run ZA and get the gear you need before sunwell. If you expect us to arrange your ZA runs and put you into a group, or if you expect us to handle loot distribution for ZA runs, you clearly don't understand how trivial this phase is. We will not be assigning groups for ZA runs, groups will form on their own. If you aren't in one of the two groups that already formed, it's probably because you are a dime a dozen face roll DPS class that everyone else plays too. Do the simple math dumb fucks. I heard multiple people taking about "cliques confirmed" last night. If you were so concerned with being in a ZA group on day 1 then maybe you should be a part of this fucking community outside of raids instead of logging on for 2 hours a week and expecting everything to be handled to you.

 I honestly don't give a fuck about ZA. I wish someone else could take my spot so I never have to step into that piece of shit. But one of the groups needs a tank so I'm willing to do my part to help the team. I really wish you fucking crybabies had the same attitude. If you're bitching about a ZA group, you're pathetic. It's a 3 day reset you fucking pussies. I remember when people left the guild because they didn't get into a Karazhan group week 1. Don't be those dumb fucks...... You dumb fucks
