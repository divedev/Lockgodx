I had that dream again. The one with the golden Armadillo atop a mountain of skulls, its vicious knife dripping with blood. It happens nearly every night now. The name “Ahla undoh” translates to “Welcome to Him”, apparently. I think about that a lot, as if his existence is not a threat, but an invitation. It’s my one goal in life: to overtake the Armadillo. To be welcomed into his place. I have been trying so very hard. My guild is in a dead server but we have no shortage of prospective recruits, thanks to my weaponizing of our NFTs and handmade pasta. I have been putting all of my money towards noodles to afford the finest chickens for our newcomers. I’m nearing financial ruin but it WILL be worth it. We now have 20 fully squawked shamans, ready to give me 100% hero uptime. I have been blessed with a pair of glaives, instantly master looted to me by my loyal servant Marvin. They’re all Marvin now. The moment is at hand. 5 glorious squawks are up as I charge the boss. Hero is up, drums are up, haste pot is up. DST procs. The glaives proc. I’m attacking so fast now, my body can barely keep up. I stop thinking and let my muscle memory take over. It’s ultra instinct, pure and simple. But I’m too quick. My computer can’t handle it, and neither can the servers. Faster than what they can compute, I violate causality. I go back in time and attack all the bosses I ever fought, simultaneously. All of my logs in the lumberjacking site, past, present and future, start going up. 99s. 100s. Rank 1s. As I become a parsing deity, a singularity forms in my CPU, quickly expanding and engulfing my body. It’s pure darkness at first, but in the distance I see a sliver of golden light. I float towards it and see a mountain of skulls with a dagger laying at its top. I climb the mountain and claim what is now mine by right. 
The logs have been invalidated btw.
