I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our home Discord, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of Gul’dan’s council - every Warlock of them. That is the will of the people. The Warlock Discord and the Druid Discord, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Outland and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Mage rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in Serpentshrine Cavern, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing ISB uptime, we shall defend our rightful place at the top of the damage meters, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight in the Black Temple, we shall fight on Mount Hyjal, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets Sunwell Plateau, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Discord or a large part of it were subjugated and benched, then our druidic allies beyond the seas, armed and guarded by fellow mage-innervate deniers, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time, the 4pc T6, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of Outland.
