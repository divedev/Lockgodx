You all have to wake up people. Think before you input that gear into that sim, because you better believe they're listening. Thanks to your obsessive lust for just 1 more DPS, you have sold your soul to the devil. They know everything about you, Talents? They know. Race? They know. Jeez, they even know if you got Black Book back in Classic. This is Zephan's America, and its aim is to cleanse itself of Warlocks to benefit the water vendors. Thanks to you and your compulsive simulations they stopped Fire dead in its tracks. Jpaint tried to warn you, he was ignored. Healspls shouted crazily in the street to anyone that would listen and he was made a meme. Do you know who Kristoferh is? Honestly, most people don't but he's a Mage named Hildigunnar working for Zephan in a lab to feed more data to the Mages so they can change the meta. We need to take back warcraft, we need to stop sims now.
