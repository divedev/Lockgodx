Gohard was a warlock of great power and great wisdom. He was also a very dear friend to the wizard, Harry. The two had been friends for many years, and Harry was always eager to help Gohard in whatever ways he could. One day, Harry was helping Gohard with some magic tasks when he noticed something strange happening. The area around Gohard's altar seemed to be filled with energy.Hearing nothing, Harry asked Gohard what was happening. Gohard replied, "There is a force coming from the altar that is causing all of this energy. It is a force that I cannot control." Harry was shocked by this information. He had never heard of such a powerful warlock being so affected by magic. Gohard then asked Harry to help him battle the force. Harry agreed and placed himself between Gohard and the force. The battle was fierce, but eventually Gohard was victorious. He Thanked Harry for his help and they left the area, happy that they had been able to stop the force from harming anyone.
