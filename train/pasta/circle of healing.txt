Blizzard needed to add a cooldown to Circle of Healing before releasing Classic TBC, this is such a stupid spell that takes no skills to use, how did they let that spell untouched for an entire expansion and also at the start of WOTLK is beyond me...
Healing 5 people at once instantly with n o cooldown, this should not be allowed, I remember seeing those 2 holy priests on pserver duo healing the entirety of SWP by mindlessly spamming CoH and with a shadow priest in their group ontop of that...
As a Druid main, it's really frustrating having to heal against this crap... And soon in Black Temple they'll be getting the mace from Illidan which will make things a lot worse... I don't get the choice of not nerfing the spell, why not give the same nerf it was given in WOTLK, a 6 sec cooldown, to give more room to the other healers...
