Of course Tyrande has a penis. Are you kidding me? Just look at her! There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Tyrande Whisperwind, the leader of the Night Elves, the "wife" to Malfurion Stormrage, who has never had a biological child of her own, is infact a fat-balled dickgirl. 

Let's look at the facts: this is a person who has no children. Absolutely none. And it's not that she doesn't have the time to -- she's lived for literally ten thousand years -- nor is she busy -- she literally stood in Darnassus for the past 9 expansions. And it's not that she doesn't want children, because she ADOPTED SHANDRIS! She ADOPTED a child as her own! Why would a biological woman with a functioning vagina do that? And as if that's not enough evidence for you.

Let's look at Tyrande's character model. If you look at Tyrande's in-game character model pre-BfA, we can see that most of her model falls along the origin of the XYZ axis -- 0 0 0. Most her vertices rest rest along the origin. HOWEVER, her CROTCH's vertices are actually longer than the rest of the model, at 0 0.5 0. Since Y measures length in this instance, we can see that of all the parts of Tyrande's model, her CROTCH - where HER penis should ANATOMICALLY be located -- is DISTENDED! Why is it so distended?

The answer is simple: because Tyrande Whisperwind, the High Priestess, has a FAT FUCKING LADYDICK. Now that we've established that it is, indeed, canon that Tyrande is a futanari, let's discuss metrics. I, for one, am leaning towards the idea that Tyrande Whisperwind's cock is, at least six inches long-- if we go by u/Leggerless's info tables on the average penis length for a night elf male, we see that thers would probably be around 6.29 inches. However in staying consistent with the typical portrayls of futanari penises -- which tend to be a few inches LONGER than the average male penis -- It's safe to say that Tyrande's actual penis length is somewhere along the line of ten to twelve inches
