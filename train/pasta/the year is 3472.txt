The year is 3472. Classic wow reforged, season of mastery 725 is about to be released. I stare out the window, looking down at Zephans America, a new dictatorship that we have comfortably learned to live in as sheep. I open up discord and check the Warlock discord. I begin shitposting for my daily meal. I post, sitting in anticipation. 8 fucking stars. Ever since Zephan raised the starboard limit to 11 back in 2021 not a single post has made it to the starboard. I watch as the stars tick up to 9….it stays there. I look on praying one more star…just one more. Haste rating begins being discussed. I close my laptop in defeat knowing the retarded conversation is about to derail and drown out my post from being at the front of the page. I throw myself out the window. “Fuck mages…” I think to myself, closing my eyes before I accept my fate in Zephans America
