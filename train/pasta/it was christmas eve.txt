It was Christmas eve. Two little Warlocks were sitting by the fire on this cold winter's night. All at once they heard a timid knock at the door, and Ryusei ran to open it.

There, outside in the cold and the darkness, stood a young Mage with no shoes upon his feet and clad in thin, ragged garments. He was shivering with cold, and he asked to come in and warm himself.

"Yes, come," they both cried; "you shall have our place by the fire. Come in!"
They drew the little wizard to their seat and shared their warmth with him, and gave him a raid spot, while the melee slept on the bench.

In the night they were awakened by a strange noise and, looking out, they saw a band of people in shining garments approaching the house. They were playing on golden harps, and the air was full of melody.

Suddenly the Stranger Child stood before them; no longer cold and ragged, but clad in arcane light.

His dark voice said: "I was cold and you took Me in. I was hungry, and you fed Me. I was benched, and you gave Me a raid spot. Rookie mistake. I am the Captain Now, wandering through the world to bring sadness and misery to all." He gazes at the picture of a strange-looking skull on the wall and chuckles. "Mage prio", he mumbles.

So saying, He broke a branch from the fir tree that grew near the door, and He planted it in the ground and disappeared. But the branch never grew into a great tree, and every year it reminded them of the betrayal. "Fuck Mages!", they proclaimed. Never again will they be deceived, for the child was now their mortal enemy, along with all like him.
