generally one of the most delusional official takes on this discord, idk why you make it to be about ZD only if its a general statement Ryu you should know my stance on ZD anyway due to TOC+chronicles existing and resurgence of the need of spellhit rating in SWP existing, generally loot is a limited resource and after distributing you cant change it, if you distribute loot objectively inefficiently eg by giving a player a 10 dps upgrade instead of giving another player a 30 dps upgrade, that hurts the performance of the raid which indirectly affects the happiness of the players since most players at least on same level care about the performance of the raid, it can also directly impact the happiness of the players if they identify the error and find out that their loot council is making ill informed decisions, therefore statement C) is incorrect, way more than 1% of guilds want to at least do as well as they can in raids, clear new content as soon as they can and then clean it in timely fashion, that statement only applies to guilds that are still 8/10 clearly indicating that they dont really care and just arent good at the game, the rest of guilds (certainly >50%) should in general aim for at least somewhat efficient loot distribution, eg give vestments to warlocks and channeled elements to others or eg not give council cloak to warlocks if all they gain from it is like 6-7 dps, while others gain 20+ and others have inferior options that are harder to obtain, just because a guild isnt exactly speedrunning doesnt mean that they shouldnt make informed decisions on loot, also preparing informed prios is a 1 time effort per phase while the proposed options are efforts that have to be done perpetually and probably they are done anyway, if loot distribution isnt only subjectively but also objectively sound, then the gain of raid strength can help mask bad play, also all of the above explains the ignorant take that is D) in that command
