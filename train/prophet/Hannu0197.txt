Does this mean scuffed drums will have cast time? or will it be instant
drums still mandatory
why are people complaining about drums, its basically buff to warlocks
so you didnt have engi?
if you didnt have engi why do you think you need LW
raids will have 1 mage and like 4-12 locks
wouldnt worry about it
whos going to use it?
wont hvae many engineers in raid
so skipping tailoring or lw?
so whats the min lvl to start transmuting tbc stuff?
Yeah thats what i meant
you cant really skip either
seed of corruption is lvl 70 spell dude
you will be farming naxx in t4 anyway
should get mark on every dps
yea but what about seed scaling, isnt SoC better with shadow gear
Is black lotus random drop from high end vanilla herbs in tbc? or same as now
on your 12 locks
alliance will have shaman in naxx first reset
so fetish isnt good at 70 anymore?
tranq totem and salvation stack in tbc right?
then threat probably wont be problem
isnt it fire totem
https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Totem_of_Wrath
well you probably want tranq over sp totem on SoC packs anyway
if guild wants fire mage, how will mage whos not fire get invited?
its not that big deal tbh, your guild should be farming naxx anyway for trinket and cloak/enchants
@Caesar thats how its been every vanilla raid
naxx is actually the first raid where bosses matter
gl having arcane/fire keep up scorch when they drop it currently with +5 fire mages
meta will be to use tranq totem on seed packs also
threat wont be problem probably most of time
if your guild is serious, they will be farming naxx and doing AQ trinket runs
if you ever read what SoC is you should hvae known fetish is good
mages should have ignite mage getting all PIs
but they dont care
3% boost to so many classes
is worth it for sure
and do we even know if prepatch will have wbuffs
has anyone tested how often flame caps respawn?
enchanting will be better until ZA patch
then everyone switches to LW
So what will be p1 bis now? T4 or spellstrike
rogue has dst
any logs with machine gun imp?
problem is drums is one more button to press, you need to stack to 8 yard every 30s
its just not worth it before better drums
also will you always be perfectly stacked and drumming on trash too?
probably not
when comparing enchanting and LW you cant just focus on bosses
if ur drumming have to be drumming on trash too
idk about drums speedrunning meta
do you really want to start drumming instead of casting one more SoC on aoe pack
depends on comp
if ur running meme classes CoR is good
dont you want KT trinkets for t6 too?
so a lot of people will run naxx
what parse week
parses dont matter
you want your best rogue on IEA
cant trust dog rogues to keep it up
tbc pservers are all mega broken tbh
only warriors need fetish in vanilla tho
its literally waste on every other class
top speedrunning guilds are alliance
fetish on alliance is whatever
yea
on alliance fetish doesnt matter so might aswell give it to mages
what progression
its 16 years old game
for progression especially you want max dps tho
kara shouldnt even be LC tbh
wont other classes want mechanar gems?
how will they even do wbosses with layers
big servers like gehennas will need +10 layers
didnt blizz already say it will be bop?
How many sapph enchants will i need for tbc shoulders? t4 , t6 atleast right but will swp have new bis shoulders too?
so will need only 2?
drums better for speedrunning probably
affli lock is always in spriest group tho
actual griefing if he isnt
you can get as many glaives as ur guild wants
just do split raids
more splits you run
more glaives you will get
glaives are very good on furies too
shade of aran has very low armor value
thats why hunters pump
yea going malediction probably wont be worth it in prepatch
https://i.nuuls.com/9_Teq.png
is this the tree what you would use in prepatch
doesnt imp scale from wbuffs too?
should be pretty strong with improved firebolt
you should always have spriest in ur group tho
why would they
only fight where mana is a bit of problem in naxx is sapph
does the imp lose buffs it dies?
priests can just shield it right?
just let it die on loatheb & sapph anyway
boss should be almost dead when dooms start
healers just will heal FG on thaddius
chain lightnings shouldnt kill him
not taking shadow embrace?
you probably want that in prepatch
tanks will have a lot less stamina
whats shadowfurys scaling from sp
its kara dude
people can clear it in greens
shamans forced to be drums slaves
so now we have forced enchanting
nothing changed
enchanting has no value when almost everyone is enchanting
@Ryusei is that real
mages are support class
support classes dont need support classes
why would you put fire mage over another destro in caster group?
just get more?
but that means SP will get boomkin also
pumping isnt fun?
uhhh spellstrike hood is pretty ugly
can i just use t4 :Pepeclown:
my fem orc is bald
i cant
real pumpers usually play the best classes
AE spam will be very risky probably also
compared to seed spamming warlocks
its kara
did people respec for ubrs+
?
or ZG
can use holy waters for them right?
thats what people did back in the days
damn that pic still going around?
does fc still have that command
8m hp mag seemed hard
4m hp mag is easy
mag was bugged also
thats why a lot of wipes happened
could 6 piece t3 be good for seed spamming :pepebrain:
how good is mark for warlocks really
until ZA patch
whats the name of mechanaar gem?
is mechanaar gem bis whole game?
and other classes shouldnt want mechanaar gem right?
and about aldor vs scryer, is there any reason to go aldor if you have 2x sapph enchants rdy for tbc
why not
will prot paladins want innervates in tbc if going fast?
just use 6 piece t3 for kara trash :pepebrain:
playing on dead servers
nah
played with frostbite+bsh until AQ
then got AQ axe+crul in like 2 resets
t4 will be naxx farm too
isnt firelock played in speedruns because theres no cos, and you usually wont get sb casts off on trash
well if someone played enhance they had some problems probably
shaman parses wtf
2 enhance doesnt sound that good
you rather have 2 ele shamans probably
if you run a lot of casters in spriest group it should be worth it
a lot of things could have been overtuned for hunters on pservers
maybe devs wanted to sell more legendary bows
hunter will be the rogue and warlock the warrior
oh so hunters will pump hard on cleave/aoe?
and pservers also used annihilator
thats extra 600 arp which they wont have in classic tbc
@Oakgu no idea :pepebrain:
dont really know anything about arcane mages
yea idk really dont care about arcane mages
need too much support to be good
warlocks will be pumping without anything
getting boosted by 39 slaves
fury before t6 is fucking copium
actual copium
his guild only cares about ahls parses
literally only thing they play for
you grab first 10 people to ding 70
and do kara
locks wont be competing with warrior spots
hunters will be
you can rep farm
trash before skeram
so have hunters figured out the phylactery thing for tbc
will it be good for them
so how long will kt trinket be good for warlocks?
until ZA?
so ZA?
and what about other classes
physical classes will have dst right
hunter pets dont scale from mark right?
crusade is worse than mark ?
16 hit rating is big tho :pepebrain:
bloodgem is only 32 hit
@Ryusei why wouldnt you use bloodgem if u need hit
on prepatch , if looking at trash+boss dps , is ds/ruin better because of imp sac and hellfire?
well it is
using flame cap also means u dont need demonic runes
paladins will be doing solo scholo farm too probably
so dark runes shouldnt be super high price
is UA worth it
could get improved firebolt
wbuffed imp will pump
:feelcraft:
mages are based
what makes quagmirrans good for affli?
does haste boost dots?
yeah but doesnt quags require high dps to be worth it
is there any idea how much gold will you get from 60-70 dungeon lvling?
https://i.nuuls.com/Q9Ctx.png
thats from EJ in 2007
there wasnt this kind of speedrunning meta on pservers
very few guilds actually did speedruns
isnt fire & shadow literally the same spec
and you only lose FSW boots
another problem in speedruns could be lack of armor debuffs
if running warlock heavy comp
furies will most likely replace hunters
way better aoe/cleave
if you run 2 mages
one of them can always go fire
just innervate the imp :pepebrain:
wouldnt you want 2nd ele over boom?
you will never use NF or annihilator on classic
thats a pserver meme
one of the reason why people overvalue hunters probably
PI doesnt stack with lusts?
So do we have any idea will they make Shining fire opal unique equip? Looks like unique equip was removed in 2.4.0 patch
yea but beta has meta gems too
it all depends on what ur guild wants to do
you run all HCs daily ofc :pepebrain:
heroic gems should be unique equip
if they made wboss drops bop
they will probably make HC gems unique equip too
rogues op s1/s2
should be unique
was changed in same patch as world boss loot
thats why you have 2x sapph enchants rdy for tbc
https://i.nuuls.com/JMlQD.png
p6 reroller btw :pepebrain:
will cthun ring & noth ring be p1 bis if hc gems will be unique equip?
thats warlock tier?
want to go male orc now
what a chad tier
isnt t6 shit 100% drop rate?
everyone will get full tier pretty quickly
proud reroller :Pepeclown:
already have mark+2x sapph enchants+fetish
8/8 (which is banned)
going felguard with pala tank isnt smart probably
wont have sunders
because all the good players play warriors :Pepeclown:
is spellfire & t4 big difference :pepebrain:
could maybe be cheap and skip spellfire :pepebrain:
mages can go imp blizzard / imp scorch spec :pepebrain:
also one big argument is support classes dont need support
:pepebrain:
so mages dont need innervates
already coping
isnt arcane just dogshit until t5 anyway
why do they want to go arcane in t3
t4*
you cant trust mages
my guess is warlock/fury stack
@Oakgu with what support?
innervates?
so double innervate?
everything will be too easy until swp
feral MT will be innervating imps between boss autoattacks ofc
will magisters terrace be added in swp patch
or on release?
you want +49 all and +51 fire?
hc gems should be unique equip
so probably not doing mechanar every day
@Ryusei isnt fire one pretty big upragde over knapsack
@Asharfh well world boss loot is bop and they were changed in same patch
supreme power
how do you get the recipe?
need any rep?
even without scorches?
that doesnt seem right
based on my feelscraft seed should be better on 4 targets atleast
tbc will have spriest eating isb stacks too
if you dont have spriest you recruit one
how much hit you want for mobs 2 lvls above you?
interesting
there will be debuff slot problems probably
so corruption probably isnt a good idea
spellstrike you mean
how good is spellfire in t5
could be not worth to make it if t4 phase is short
that raid
you always want atleast 2 locks
that raid group is actual troll
3 rogues?
3 furies can be viable
but 3 rogues is too much
those groups are something else too
why even bother running ele shaman in this raid
yeah rage gain was brutal
im expecting a lot more hunter/warlock rerollers after prepatch
furys lose all their rage
they actually get 0 rage
it really is
warlocks might very well be #1 dps in prepatch
hellfire is strong
spriests in evey raid
mages lose ignite stacking
less warrior means less sunders
nah furys get hard nerfed
you cant press buttons if u dont have rage
@Ryusei it is nerfed at 60
very hard
how is 15% extra dmg not big
spriest
warriors lose all their rage in prepatch
i mean you can go hit on dummies outside org
and see how much rage you get
skeram will be hardest part for sure
https://i.nuuls.com/vrV8r.png
hello fellow warlock mains
:pepebrain:
6 piece t6 is probably better if aoe capped
but you probably just want to stack haste/crit anyway to bypass aoecap
is that only assuming st dmg?
only gear id spend money on right now is probably mark of the champion & cthun ring
and fetish
everything else is easily replaceable
cant we just go shadow :pepebrain:
not even 5-6 mages can keep up scorch
wait we actually have to play demo? :feelcraft:
https://i.nuuls.com/ugTuI.png
this is bis name
so is demo good spec now?
does it want any craftables in p1
my group will have all physical debuffs probably
doesnt survival hunter also buff other hunters?
:pepebrain:
fire is better spec :pepebrain:
nono if you run LC you give loot to pumper specs :pepebrain:
support classes get loot last
loot doesnt matter in tbc tbh
youll get everything in 10 resets probably
lmao
it was bait & switch
fucking blizzard
:Pepeclown:
they wont have rage to keep up cleave permanently
like they do now
aggro will be problem with heavy fury stack too
classic bosses have like 100 armor
49 actually i think
after imp ea
and ally reduces that 0
why 2 arcanes
could easily run 0 in melee heavy comp
no
you always want 4 locks in raid imo
but you can cut hunters for furies
ele shaman is already twisting sp and tranq totem :feelcraft:
demo will be the :pepebrain: play for t4 & t5 probably
is it even 100 dps increase
spellfire vs t4
wasnt it like 10 dps?
isnt demo super good on nightbane
if skeletons are magic immune
doesnt demo gear exactly same as shadow destro
pets get your crit value right?
how good is sapph cloak in p1
actually bis ?
:pepebrain:
you will be running naxx for enchants & phylactery anyway
atiesh is just a byproduct
can do big pulls too with seed & paladin tanks
blizzard will pump t5 out early
gruul+mag is literally 15 min
wasnt t5 out on release in real tbc
whats stopping them from releasing t5 and keeping arena s1
problem is t4 has no content
they released vanilla stuff early too
dire maul was early
BGs were early
AQ20 had like 1 good loot
people just farmed it for rep
hammer was useless on horde
bracers of brutality were the only good loot tbh
still using them
you just need to look at how many rogues are there in speedruns in vanilla
pserver hunter player is here
@takenote will people be using annihilators in classic tbc?
tbc pservers
are actual dogshit
difference is vanilla pservers actually worked
compared to tbc ones
@takenote so whats ur opinion on annihilators in classic tbc
will people be using them?
at what lock amount do you have 100% isb uptime
so its doable
2 destro groups+affli
3-4% is massive tho
demo will be best spec in p1 probably right? both mag and gruul favor pet specs
how big is it?
do demo tree buffs work on enslaved demon?
double shadow?
why
2 spriest is just waste
and you want affli
mag was bugged on beta
it will be faceroll if people click cubes
you understand gruul is all about dps?
faster it dies less dmg he does
whats wrong with rerollers
they carried raids on furies
and now they do it on warlocks
Is malediction worth in prepatch, or is it too big loss without ruin
is malediction lock worth it in prepatch
even for normal fire lock?
so demonic sacrifice isnt worth it? :pepebrain:
has anyone actually tested imp on beta?
scorch is 5 stacks
15%
running 2 spriest is actual griefing
how good is warlock in 5s?
and whats best spec
loot wont be a problem tbh
you will have t4 head before spellstrike probably
loot is way different in tbc my dude
you have full bis in 10 weeks
any news on HC gems?
how fast do you replace t3 chest
https://i.nuuls.com/LTLNV.png
this?
because of gem sockets or what
oh yeah found it
and what about bloodgem
is it better than tear
yea 40 is very cheap
compared to buying gold and boosts
what t6 pieces will we be using for set bonus?
in swp too? @Ryusei
so head/shoulders/belt/boots
p1 speedrun will be kara
i just dont see sm/ruin beating deep destro on total
no one cares about parses
deep destro has imp too
you dont cast corruption on tras
trash
mobs die in max 10s
barely can even get shadowbolts off
why cast corruption on mobs 3&4 when you can just hellfire
:pepebrain:
25 vs 40 man roster is big difference
destro lw
:feelcraft:
deep destro will be bis for total anyway
just get 2 sapph enchants :pepebrain:
demo should be high skill ceiling
yea have priests on imp shield duty :pepebrain:
blood pact is better buff for casters anyway :pepebrain:
more % hp increase
trusting mage to keep scorch up when they cant keep it up with 6 fire mages :Pepeclown:
what overall in t4
theres like 3 trash mobs in 25 mans
how can mage even compete with warlocks
they have to drink
wait when using mgi , do you bind /cast firebolt or /petattack to everything
yea but is /cast firebolt and /petattack same thing
if rogue doesnt expose
he doesnt get invite
its that simple
imp ea is the only reason to bring rogue
is it actually confirmed we will get non unique equip HC gems?
well beta has chaotic skyfire diamond too right?
and bop wboss loot
well wboss loot is bop
and will be switched to boe later right
yeah but you need hit cap :feelcraft:
even though you will always have 1% resist chance
:feelcraft:
can you eat someone elses immolate with conflag?
oh no no no roguebros
its over
does that mean eu is delayed too?
you still need to cast corruption for shadow embrace right?
cat dps wasnt going to happen anyway
when furies dont have raid spots
fucking based
its warlock expansion after all
@Healspls classic annihilator is absolute dogshit proc
compared to pservers
no one will run annihilators
thats 600 ARP every phys dps is missing
so another buff for locks
rivenspike has very good proc compared to anni tho
because it doesnt stack with FF
and you cant FF twin melee boss
thats why it was used
male orc is bis
i regret rolling fem orc
male orc is great especially on warrior
https://i.nuuls.com/5WW8U.png
peak warrior
deviate fish is required consumable for tauren tanks
we had one patchwerk wipe because of tauren hitbox :Pepeclown:
imagine not having your tbc main ur old summon alt
:Pepeclown:
this server needs copium emote
just get twins neck :pepebrain:
parsing set is 0 hit/crit
all spell power
isnt belf technically bis :pepebrain:
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/tbc/news/imp-in-a-ball-with-6-month-tbc-subscription/
imp in a ball + MGI will be pog
but they tick down right
in real time
rogues dont know :pepel
they will be on imp ea slave duty whole expansion
go deep destro
:feelcraft:
best on total
kinda want it for loatheb
on sapph you will get healed anyway
its basically FREE on use trinket
its going to get delayed again
every meta is nice for locks
warriors of tbc
how many of each mark do i need for lvl 70 bg gear?
:Pepeclown:
i think blizzard might be the most incompetent gaming company there is
is improved drain soul broken
it doesnt give mana
yea but mobs are grey
is that why it doesnt give mana?
no we dont
we are better class in every way
FG or deep destro for naxx
wont have ele shaman probably
have like 700 SP unbuffed
@Crix from all BGs?
can you get locked from naxx too?
FG is meta? :pepe_sweat:
MGI :Pepeclown:
has to be bis
:feelcraft:
@Healspls remove lips
oh no no
he actually took atish
atiesh
where do i get my vanilla warrior tag?
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/gehennas/hannuu?zone=1006&new=true
is this proof enough?
rerolled warlock because its top dps class ofc
👍
just go soul leech :pepebrain:
doenst succubus eat ISB
shadow because it has ISB
:pepebrain:
that raid comp is fine
1 hunter
:pepebrain:
not really
the usual fuck hunters
no thats my take
@Cillo press soulshatter
well it only makes sense
spell power works always
crit is useless if you crit and hit is useless if you hit
so firelock bis whole tbc? :pepebrain:
demo lock wants 4 piece t4?
which pieces would you use
sure you can
its just going to shoot other people too
we had one lock with nether protection in our gdkp
was fine
but maybe we were lucky
recruit mages?
you get more honor at 70 right?
we better hope HC gems are unique
fuck farming that shit
it has to be higher dps right
or why use it
siphon life / soul link
@givemetheformuoli juicy bear burgers too
did they fix ZG thing
at what point does doom calc the dmg
when its casted or when it procs?
like do you pop CDs before you cast doom
or when its about to pop
what about shadow vulnerability
:pepebrain:
So do we want to buy all pvp gear for arenas or can we get better stuff from raids/dungeons?
@Aloysius one warrior is there for battleshout
does imp get lust?
maybe PI on imp could be a thing
MGI is just a meme
theres no way imp will survive fights
@bwps_02 👀
can you share that
@bwps_02 is it for pve or will you make pvp version too?
but succubus eats ISB stacks right?
get engi and replace what?
melees should have engi
if you run hunters
you need like 5 support classes for them
in that comp you just go shadow lock
and dont care about arcanite dragonlings
if you play arena you basically need enchanting
it is 24 sp
im looking at the pinned pvp gear requirements, post says blue set pants need AB marks but wowhead says it requires WSG marks, which one is correct?
so pinned post is wrong?
is ZG enchant good for pvp?
yea but helm/leg Zg enchant is never good?
possible to add spell lock / devour magic if felhunter is up?
nice 👍
yes but no one played fire on pservers :feelcraft:
what pieces of t4 will we be using for set bonus in t5? shoulders and?
replacing shoulders also hass enchant problem
does t4 proc have cooldown?
p1 will be like 2 months
people will get tired to 15 min raids very quick
you probably dont want to get pushback from attacks tho
you still need paladin
no?
why would they
stop caring about parses
they never mattered
your comp/kill speed will matter the most
like it does in vanilla
nah u pretty much always want ISB
you might have spriest in ur dungeon group/10 man but not fire mage
yes but did u guys know ISB increases shadow damage by 20%?
:feelcraft:
just ban spriests mind blast :pepebrain:
:pepebrain:
what about downranking shadow bolt if boss is low hp? :pepebrain:
to make sure it hits
yes downraking CoR to cuck melees
:pepebrain:
down ranking corruption just doesnt make sense
if mages refuse to go fire, warlocks refuse to use cor :pepebrain:
what is DN
i thought it was just a deez nuts meme
yea imp dies way too easily
affli is probably only worth if they arent in caster grp
shadow embrace wonbt matter
you want max dps in prog
tanks wont die
theres also the isb problem
if people dont run affli
and destros are fire
tanks had pretty shit gear
every 200 attempts?
its tbc
i dont think thats how math works
just apply coe on everything and then start seeding
only one lock in raid?
you always want atleast 2
how many casters?
well shouldnt go affli then
no
2 mages isnt enough
heavy destro probably isnt that bad
you have backlash
5 locks is only problem if you run 2 mages
well could turn the spriest group into ele shaman one too
6 healers is probably overkill for farm anyway
if you want to precast use immo
high spell power
it has highest passive spell power right excluding mark
yea should go to spriest first
!dn
imagine not using elvui
:pepebrain:
any hunter experts here? how good is DST for them
but when do hunters replace it
thats a good thing
you could say same thing about warlocks tho
people actually stop and drink in raids?
thats p1 shit?
they are probably rigging the results to get DST
:pepebrain:
ret isnt getting it
actual bottom tier dps
rets still will be bottom dps
but when do hunters replace DST?
p2 ?
p3 ?
do we know if HC gems will be unique equip?
not looking forward to farming mech everyday
bloodgem or icon if under hit cap? :feelcraft:
in what phase do you stop using mechanar gems?
how many gems do we need for whole game
is auchenai crypt gem bis too?
so realistically only need mechanar gems for t4&t5?
how many auchenai gems do we want?
didnt EJ sim hunters dps like 2.1k in swp bis?
minmaxers will clear naxx in tbc
phylactery is too good
doesnt that mean infinite source of motes of fire :pepebrain:
dont think you need frost res for sapph at 70
less people means less people to heal
sneed's seed & feed 
formely chuck's
like 1500g raw gold
or from blues n shit?
so they nerfed nightbane?
doesnt it work on bosses because they are +3 your lvl
sapph enchant is bis anyway
if you want to minmax
can use ZG enchant for pvp right
wait curse of doom cant crit?
spellcloths will tank very quickly
demand lowers
so many people will have tailoring alts compared to real tbc
and compared to pservers
most expensive thing will be primal fire most likely
why would you craft bloodvine? or t3 pieces you replace them in tbc
:Pepeclown:
atlas loot says HC gems are unique too
https://i.nuuls.com/_O9N6.png
they werent earlier i think
few days ago
well thats how they were until swp release
how does it work if they are unique
if you have one slotted cant loot more?
so have to delete item if you want to get new gem
so is CSD ingame?
so CSD is confirmed?
what head will we use in t5?
t4 helm isnt better because of set bonus in t5?
spellstrike legs
you go legs first always
so if CSD is in what 2 set piece will we use in t5?
@Korvo so what pieces do you use for t4 2 set bonus in t5?
is there any confirmation about CSD?
will we use t4 helm+shoulders in t5?
or some other combo
boots / belt of blasting?
???
ofc you have room for immo corruption
only warlocks & spriest really uses debuff slots
its not
healers 0 debuff slots
most melee dps 1
arcane mage 0
guys
what t4 2 piece will we use in t5 now
who cares about t4, what pieces will we use in t5 for set bonus
so i can argue locks should get prio on helm+shoulders
shadow feels better
fire was a meme after all
whats the CSD requirement?
oh yeah
pserver nerds were right?
affli best?
based on my feelcraft fire is dogshit
can major spellpower enchant drop already?
problem is
you need to keep pet alive
good luck with that
best spec is shadow destro :Pepeclown:
does anyone know if you get enough rep to do nightbane if you clear everything expect aran?
but not without resets?
even if you clear animal bosses?
i have spriest & fire mage in my kara, should i go fire or shadow
tanks shouldnt be using TF
so doesnt matter really
well if you want ur tank to use shit weapon
feel free
you cant tank it
he crushes
and crits
you cant mitigate dmg in anyway
have to outheal it
or kite it
thats how we killed him
you can skip him too
with invis pots
or atleast stealth works
so do we know how unique epic gems work right now
if you socket one
can you get more gems?
or they wont appear at all?
if raid has 2 mages
one should be fire 100%
2x arcane mages is a meme probably
like good guilds will have 2 druids
thats only 2 innervates
if fights are long
2x arcane mage is useless
resto druid is the first cut
if you want more dps
bloodlust is just too good
people will replace resto druid with shaman very fast
!hit
what was the hit rating command
what are the blue gems to fulfill CSD requirements?
some epic jewels from HC?
wheres your spreadsheet
if you have 4 tailors
you can have 4 alchemists too
why is so many shaman enha :pepehands:
they could be actually a good spec
400g for primal nether isnt that high tbh
i got fed up with imp during leveling
fuck 10s summons
not really if you picked the real faction
and you dont need hit cap
every raid doesnt want affli for sure
-5% dmg is literally irrelevant
if you run 4 locks sure have one go affli
but with 3 locks its better to go all destro
t4 helm for sure
spellfire doesnt have helmet
t4 helm is better
because of chaotic skyfire diamond
fellow feelscrafter :pepebrain:
:clowntaclysm:
im not so sure about this spec
if you have 2 locks everything dies before they reach you
in kara
yep
ur tanks suck
unless ur talking trash
shouldnt have any problems with salv
what tank did you have
our tank used full mitigation on attunemen
had aggro problems
and then switched to more threat gear and no problems
heroic OHF is a problem
sure its doable if you get ur guildies to come
idk
just did mechanar HC with pug was pretty smooth
but im on gehennas so idk
+20 sp or +15 hit on t4 gloves
if animal boss can roll +78 boots
how good are those?
if its 78 fire dmg
can any mage spec tank HKM
guys is +78 fire/shadow boots roll from animal bosses bis p1?
what spell is coe considered
can it proc t4
should i put mechanar gem in t4 helm
or normal 9 sp
t4 helm and shoulders right
pretty sure t4 helm+shoulders is bis
in t5
i think mech gem is best in t4 red socket
because you want hit gems in yellows anyway
you can only have one
yea
yellow/red
should be lock prio
its t5 bis
any idea how rare major spell power weapon enchant is
i have killed like 50 spell thiefs and havent got it , my friend killed 2 and got it
firestone or wand of fates if below hit cap?
why is hit cap so important
you can always miss
theres literally no difference between 1% and 2% miss chance
you always have 1% resist chance
but they work same way?
csd for 50g?
thats low
@sil just get thrallmar exalted
save all your dkp until bt :pepebrain:
raid with blue gear
dkp is awful.
even /roll is better
use coe
dkp is literally the worst system
even /roll is better
problem is
ret is actually shit in 10 mans
casters rly only want salv
2nd paladin is waste
i heard prince is fixed now
is it true
cant stand at the door
was someone over him in aggro
like raw threat
does anyone have food & water macro that first uses conjured stuff?
does anyone have fat crit stacking gear set for seed? 👀
@Seikusa yea pretty sure its not worth it
conflag has shit scaling
might aswell reapply immolate
hardest part for us was p3
the stun & click thing
being on tongue duty cucks you hard tho
also banish duty
awful fight for locks
@Healspls even for fire mages?
this is important info :pepebrain:
nice :pepebrain:
how does dot clipping work in tbc
does it extend duration if you reapply when immolate has 1s or something left
so should aim to reapply immolate right after it ends?
and now t4 vs spellstrike  :pepebrain:
whats the problem
just go spellcloth spec
craft spellfire
get t4
you have best of both worlds
@Mutate just get t4
should be free for demo warlock
how many badges will we want for other phases?
why?
if they dont have a fire mage
get a fire mage
well thats just griefing
if i need hit from bloodgem, is it better to use icon or quags as 2nd trinket?
affliction 10% hit is useless
t5 doesnt have any good offpiece gloves?
well what gloves have sockets?
well if you break spellfire in t5, what gloves would you want?
im just using helm+shoulders in t5 tbh
but what gloves do we want? kara/mag or kt?
remember socket bonus
pretty sure marshals is bis
https://i.nuuls.com/zwV0Z.png
where to use this
t4 helm?
stam isnt 0 value
pvp bracers are better for sure
shaman totems dont stack anymore right?
atleast spell power totem doesnt
even questing is better xp probably
only noobs stack hit/crit
chads go for full spell power/haste
i was using r1 banish on mag
eye is shit
use both icon/bloodgem if ur under hitcap
eye only works on full resists
oh quags
yes tbc warlocks rotation will be so hard :pepebrain:
if you play well you will parse good :pepebrain:
you dont take consecration
you use pvp trinket
well then you have some dps problems
doesnt make sense tho
they could be playing the ultimate support spec
imp scorch / imp blizzard
deez nuts
does other warlocks seed proc seeds
i think fire is a meme
mages should be arcane/frost in t5
yes but you lose a lot of trash dps
and dont need to sac swap
shadow is just straight up better spec in t5
you lose trash dmg from not having arcane/frost mage
???
all of my point were very valid
thing is
arcane/frost is so much better at aoe
theres no point to go arcane/fire
im talking about aoe/trash dps
point of doing more dps is to get out of raid faster
in t4?
theres 6 trash packs in whole t4 content
none of them really aoe
theres difference between t4 & t5 @Korvo
arcane/frost aoe is very good
what speedrunning guilds
yes
i said trash dmg doesnt matter in t4
because theres no real trash
tongues also destroys ur dps
does anyone know how enslave works if 2 warlocks juggle mob in turns
shadow is the way to go tbh
atleast in t5
because mages will be going arcane/frost in t5
and if ur going to speedrun, you wont have time to switch sacs between trash & bosses
is haste meta gem better than CSD for oblivion seeding set
wont have ruin bonus on seed anyway right?
theres always 1% resist chance
haste or CSD meta gem for seeding set?
hunters get their t4 bis from dungeons for free
warlocks will catch up once more people get crafted stuff
how many locks for mag
if ur on banish / cot duty its over
yea
t4 is dogshit fights for locks
id recommend destro
demo is harder to play
why even kill the imp
what does it even do
so could be cleaved down
dont need to focus it fist?
first*
quags is pretty common imo
seen multiple already
pretty sure felhunter is the last interrupt you want
warrior tanks can interrupt too
spell lock is 24s cd
high resist chance
just get arms warrior
you should atleast have arms warrior
locks need to focus on tongues & infernals
rest of the raid can handle interrupts
@Skycrab remember to reapply cot and use rank 2 banish :pepebrain:
not using curse of doom on curator is the trick
use coe
then use recklessness
dont you have seed bosses in later raids
for me its enchanting
gnomish battle chicken?
vanilla version?
you dont need to be gnomish engi for that
you can just switch to goblin after crafting it
idk i did it in vanilla
shattered halls is very hard if you dont have good group
i tried tanking it , but then got crushed for 8k
resisted 0 dmg
you cant reduce dmg with shadow res im pretty sure
only way is stamina
boots of blasting
thing is
t4 pieces are pretty free
only locks really want them
you have to wait 30 min
outside
does anyone know whats the odds of getting alchemy discovery?
will tk / ssc drop 1 token per boss too?
black temple too?
why would mage ever take t4 chest
740 sp is very low
you wont parse good
nope
4pc oblivion set if ur below aoe cap, if above stack crit/haste
moroes fight is good for seed too
need fetish tho
shackling any add is griefing
just nuke them down
cor isnt 10% extra dmg tho
its like 5-6%
could be even less in tbc
or have a lot of other casters
and coe boosts enha shamans dps too
probably is better
but coe isnt 0 value for them
fire totem
because its not
closer to 0 you get better it is
yea it was massive alliance advantage
annihilator wont be used in classic
proc rate is too shit
yea sure they used in tbc funservers
but on classic proc chance is too low
no :Pepeclown:
use coe
well cor atleast doesnt help with tank survivability
no sapph enchant is bis
if you want bis
how does princes hp reduction work, do you need to be topped off before it comes?
or can you be at 50% and it still reduces you to 1 hp?
mag is literally perfect fight for furies too
thing is warlock is even better on trash
so why bring melee class
and tear isnt dogshit?
problem is mages need to drink
and you dont want to drink in speedrun
if it works on seed :feelcraft:
big numbers
that means tlc lock prio?
are your hunters misdirecting tank?
you shouldnt have any issues with salv tbh
isnt t4 helm bis too
in t5
yes im sure there are better items for everyslot but you still want t4 set bonus
shoulders bis until t6, weapon you replace in t5
ez choice :pepebrain:
@InsaneKane pretty sure thats wrong, CoD isnt extra 150 dps
you have to use global for it
idk its not that big
cant crit
you really dont want 2 spriests
no its not
every shaman is extra bloodlust
resto druid, holy priest
yes it will
healing wont be problem in any content
healer group
yea
well it is and will be done
and moonkin grabs imp motw anyway
so resto druid is literally 0 utility
:Pepeclown:
that doesnt make sense
no just go pure sp and haste, if ur lucky ur going to have 100% crit & hit chance anyway
we havent had any problems
u guys must be doing something wrong, we havent had a single double cast
is mage warlock viable 2s comp?
uhm
why isnt enslave on logs
that doesnt make sense
so dealing dmg on boss doesnt count in logs because ?
why?
both are same dmg
should we ban pet dmg next
quite literally the same thing
@Kited you mean logging?
@Kited https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/ , should have some resources
what t6 pieces will we use in bt
illidan helm means no wings right
cant be good :pepebrain:
did we get any confirmation on how TLC works
who cares about parses
its good for paladins too :Pepeclown:
:Pepeclown:
how are mats free
???
always do servants quarters, got 41 agi bracers today for our surv hunter
how do you even time it, you always get 15s timer on ceiling fall and 20s on click after you push under 30%
yea
we havent had that ever
do u guys wait until he starts to cast and then click?
we always click once we see castbar on boss
0 double casts for us tho
you need to have 4
and tank clicks?
nova is 45s
cd is 3 min
uhh are you seeding in heroics?
its only safe with mage tbh
@samyope on some items with, like t4 helm and shoulders
t4 shoulders because you need 2x blue gems to active CSD anyway
@Healspls how does TLC work with seed
but can one seed proc it multiple times?
so it should be good for seeding?
would be nice if we had retail style tools
u got mindblade?
u should be very happy
4th destro works if you make 2nd caster grp
2 mage/spriest/destro/ele
affli lock still boosts spriest dps
whats better if i have other spellfire pieces and t4 helm, spellfire or t4 gloves?
drops in kara my man
im in same situtation, so whats better spellfire set bonus or t4 set bonus
nope, theres very low demand for them rest of the game
casters need like 10 spell+shadowcloth rest of the game
spellcloth is 124g on gehennas
theres like 5 months until p2
people have crafted millions of cloths by then
how long did it take?
you didnt cast corruption because of 16 debuff slots
1000 with 164 hit? thats pretty good
spellfire helps a lot
t4 helm+shoulders = weapon > other loot
:Pepeclown:
why would hunter even want it
:Pepeclown:
its not even hc
its from lvl 70 dungeons
i went 3x veiled noble topaz, but should have went 2x veiled+1 blue gem
so you dont run into problems with CSD if shadow
@Mentis its still bis in p2
you dont want to use t4 legs
not even on demo
demo lock wants helm/shoulder/gloves/chest
uhh what gruul gloves?
mag drops gloves
pretty sure
almost every kara is undead
or demon
yep
mark is 3rd best trinket
well 4th
i lost my fire mage on first shatter :pepehands:
also lost my ele shaman
but atleast he had ankh
you can use both
not the 30sp part
what do you mean
no
only autoattacks
no? 30sp is very good
t4 fights are shit for warlocks anyway
see you in t5
stealing other peoples immolates would be fun with conflag
:pepebrain:
kihra*
shes our girl
the smart play is to go for veiled noble topaz
is soulfrost even good
you cast immolate
tbc gearing is literally 0 time
press some buttons in AH and you have full prebis
dont even need to swipe
just sell consumables
cant wait for swp tbh
must be fun to pump with all that haste
tapping is faster with haste
tapping with lust feeels pretty good
tapping without lust feels even worse
i wonder if tapping with quags proc is a good idea
:pepebrain:
did he just post seeding HKM log
@Ataxis how does arcane/fire gimp them
arcane beats any melee
but sure if you stack raid full of hunters / locks
dps, and bonus of not being melee
fury with 24 people supporting him
sure
youll see in t5
i was talking about t5 dude
sure fury stack might work in t6
but not t5
idk
locks will just rape everything later on
if t5 content is difficult and people start cutting melee
hunters lose their support
idk im thinking tbc content will be harder
you wont have wbuffs fucking all the tuning
prenerf lady vashj & KT should be hard
you cant compare vanilla horde to alliance
lack of paladins makes horde just dogshit faction
dungeon xp was dogshit in pservers
everyone solo quested
if you dont have fire mage always why would you go fire
but if raid has spriest (they will always have one) shadow is better
so you sac succubus and seed?
so you cant press shadow bolt if ur fire?
whats stopping me
just use bloodgem if u dont have ele shaman
? its not useless in t5
yeah into arcane/fire
yea arcane/fire
1. seed has shit scaling
2. you dont really seed in heroics @Lockedaway
if ur going spellfire u will only miss shadoweave boots from shadow bis
and who cares about t5, theres still 5 months of t4
if t5 content drops 1 token, it might take a while
i will thanks :pepebrain:
@Ezay worse at what?
sac succubus
only shadowweave boots are bis dude
so craft spellfire while waiting ur t4 loot
whats the problem
arcane/fire right
multiple mages going arcane/frost is actual griefing
then he should go arcane/fire
or just fire
@Quackin girdle of ruination too
how are u guys poor in this game
just click buttons in AH and you have infinite money
@Ezay good for you, so just swipe and buy ur bis
it is
destro pot is hard griefing in long fight
mana pot
its not even healing
but tapping is lost globals
which you want to avoid
on mag destro pot is good probably
because you get free taps
ofc affli goes for imp cow :pepebrain:
so boss doesnt oneshot the tank
no spriest in 25 man?
time to switch guild my dude
ur going to 16 man raids?
yea blizzard better release t5 early
8k, my incinerates hit 7.4k :pepebrain:
it cant be worth it
just cast incinerates
t4 shoulder if you have
put mechanar and sp/ub gem on t4 shoulders
yea you want +12 sp red gem on helm
surv hunters get sick loot
saw +41 agility bracers drop
ur supposed to stack veiled noble topaz
best gem
did badge actually drop
yeah gl getting badge to drop
saw 2 in all of classic
lust on warlocks is just broken
you have to be shadowweave tailor if u want to use shadowweave boots
nothing really
demand for cloths will be very low
everyone else will be doing that too
spellcloth could very well go below craft mats
affli does coe
other lock cor
keep the normal curses up
even the elitist jerks post says fire might be better
because of new talent
if spriest has prince dagger and all crafted shit he can pump in p1
spriests are decent in p1
but fall off hard later
belt requires nether vortexes right
blizz can see your boss kills very easily
i wouldnt do it unless its confirmed not exploit
@Fury pretty sure it isnt
t5 helm + jc is better than engi helm
warlocks wont need super sappers
they rather be seeding
any of your melees / tanks can pop seeds with sappers
but this dude saying engi > jc in t5 is just wrong
it literally isnt
affli is pretty big boost to raid
if ur running firelocks only
how is affli terrible memespec
and affli isnt just malediction
shadow embrace is pretty good too
and its also isb for spriest
thing is atm most raids are running afflilock in tank grp
which means no sp totem
most afflis arent even in sp totem grp
most dont use imp for dmg
are most afflis even running ruin with CSD atm
once people start running afflis in real groups and using imp for dmg, gap shoudnt be that big
splits for 6 months of t4 :Pepeclown:
if you have all 5 stacked and let volleys go through
its a wipe
gotta control infernals for long time too
and 5 being alive will spawn more infernals than usual
so how many hunters do you take?
for 5 mob cleave
so you want to 5 mob cleave with hunter stack
and who is going to interrupt
you want to stack furies for mag speedkill
arent they stun immune
but doesnt really matter, you dont bring hunters for mag speedkill
and if you do you wont stack all adds
no you bring as many furies as you can
1 rogue,1 arms,1 surv hunter,2 locks
furies bring interrupt
you cant count on enha shaman interrupt
5 mobs just feel a bit low for seeding
locks will run oom super fast
lock runs oom too
882 mana cost
you get what 1.75 seeds per tap
going to be a lot of tapping
badge gear is enough for it?
probably
why wouldnt you save it
https://i.nuuls.com/3uquX.png
t4 shoulder waiting room
t4 helm / mindblade
gruul sword might never drop
i have 2 so not a problem
but not taking mindblade if you could is stupid
imo its equal prio
t4 helm is/should be pretty free anyway
if i had one i would save it for t6 tbh
unless ur guild is planning to run more naxx
you will be using t4 helm for long time
mages / hunters should have prio on t5 helm
its arguable
you could keep t4 whole phase
and just use some offpiece gloves
yes and t5 shoulders are better than t4
t5 gloves too
but you still want t4 set bonus
actually let me calc this, but im pretty sure t4 helm is better
yes we all know t5 loot is better than t4
but you still want 2 piece set bonus
https://i.nuuls.com/t8wkK.png
looks to me t4 helm is better
its more about mag gloves vs t4 gloves
oh and big minus is blue socket on t5 helm too
2x 9 sp gems
but yeah blue gem socket on t5 helm makes it a bit worse
because you dont get 100% free socket bonus
https://i.nuuls.com/9XHN8.png
so wanna debunk this
fury
26 crit vs 16sp +4 hit
you always get socket bonus on t4 helm
on t5 helm not always
so dont run hit gems
and you get 164 no problem
dont even need to think about hit?
oh true
https://i.nuuls.com/E9Td7.png
so its this
i ignored helm gem slots
because those dont matter
only head bonus matters
but on gloves ofc it matters
its straight up 18 sp
and the fact is
locks are last prio on t5 helm
how many tokens will drop
in t5
and raid has what 3-4 hunters, 1-2 mages
it will be a while
and idk, spellfire gloves seem pretty good still in t5 if ur fire
https://i.nuuls.com/1Ts1f.png
so surely you have some kind of comeback
so you value 13 crit over 17 sp + 4 hit ?
is that it?
i knew you would say something about stam
but yeah you are right, we should ignore it
run it with spellfire gloves
and idk
your t5 set has multiple +6sp  5hit gems
and t4 set has one
t4 helm+spellfire is straight up better
idk what you are on
1133sp vs 1113
and thats with ur t5 having multiple +6sp 5 hit gems
do you really value 11 crit over 27 sp and 4 hit
do you really do that?
https://i.nuuls.com/4sm5Z.png
27 sp vs 11 crit
which is better
any warlock experts here
27 sp or 11 crit
so we shouldnt use spellfire now because it has no stam
right ?
so we should value stam in our stat weights?
this means spellfire is shit right?
just admit it you are wrong
and stop telling people t5 helm is bis
when its not
you will be farming kara and gruul for the next 5 months
so we should be using t4 over spellfire because it has stam?
right now?
stamina was important in vanilla  because of wbuffs
even with full spellfire i have 6.8k unbuffed hp
its really not a problem
why would you hs after cave in
theres 0 raid dmg
its better to use in p1 if volleys go through
shares rune / flame cap cd
sure but it still shares cd with runes and flame caps
so you dont use consumables on farm content?
so skip conflag
and just tap
is the trolls blood thing even worth for ferals
they lose flask
yea
you could use flask
can you juggle dog with 2 warlocks
wouldnt call it rare
seen it many times now
how
you have all veiled noble topaz gems?
its week 3?
you should have full crafted gear
has anyone tested if csd requirement is broken too :pepebrain:
heading to dr boom as we speak
@Dratin both
yea
all destros fire and affli is optimal
its optimal in t5
t4 it was optimal to have all fire and afflilock
but doesnt really matter
if the shadow lock wants to do less dps let him
succubus dies easily
i would be running fire destro in dungeons
unless you have spriest
shadow and fire destro is literally the same spec
we are talking about dungeons
and your raid should always have a fire mage
or arcane/fire
its melee and range hit right
https://i.nuuls.com/jI7d4.png
use wowhead
yep
hit is only useful if ur hitting mobs +3 ur lvl
go cor/coe
if ur not cot
normal poh works even if target isnt LoS
uhhh
why
that means everyone gets shit parses
just cuck one guy hard if u rotate it
we do 1,2,2
doesnt really matter
mag is dogshit fight
if u want good parse, you need 0 assignments during channelers
and not be clicking
and crit during banishes
how does pala keep aggro
DN is a meme
wtf
theres no way DN is a good spec
its assuming ur pet lives
(it will not)
good spec? fire destro, shadow destro
ur imp or whatever is going to survive on trash? :Pepeclown:
i can tell you this about meta
no one will play DN
like why even talk about dn
its dogshit spec
shadow destro is better
ok
show me dn logs
cant stun channelers
i dont care about parses
only my dps
you dont replace gloves in t5
t4 helm+spellfire gloves is bis
no
you go helm+shoulders for bonus
and spellfire gloves
nope
i calculated this earlier
https://i.nuuls.com/4sm5Z.png
its proof enough for me
17 more sp
4 hit
vs 11 crit
im not simming
im calculating stats item has
vs other items
well spriest loses a lot of dps
without isb
like t4 gloves are just absolute dogshit
i have no idea why u guys ever thought we would use them t5
and its not like we are getting t5 helm tokens ever
then you prio it to mages > hunters > locks
@Baddies they will
its simple as that
who cares what mages think
guild says there will be imp scorch
and there will be one
if hes a pumper he will go arcane/fire
ofc arcane/fire will be bis
its just straight up better
IV just ooms them faster
like how many people even run afflilock in sp totem / spriest group
yes he should?
yes he should
???
are you actually clueless
stop talking here
every shaman has sp totem
and afflilock has prebis?
using imp when he can?
ofc dogshit geared affli wont do 70% of spellfire warlock
theres nothing to talk
atleast one mage will be arcane/fire in t5
in t4 just run normal fire mage
many afflis dont even have sp totem
not having 100 sp is massive difference
people are putting them in tank groups
yea new guild tbh
good guild wouldnt be running shadow locks
what do you mean
fire lock does more dmg
what speedrunning in t4
we will be doing t4 content for the next 5 months
if blizzard doesnt release t5 early
not really
t5 was release way before s2 in real tbc
fire will be good in t5 too
maybe once you have t5 bis you can go shadow
and mag has the tongues / banish problem
clicking problem
mag parses are literally irrelevant
id say HKM but that is cheesed
so probably kara parses
but those are all about your comp
what
i didnt say anything about "fire demo"
gl playing ur demo in t5 content
yeah
if you didnt have fetish you were hard fucked
mages are ultimate :Pepeclown:
buying 9sp gems in p2 will be expensive
item upgrades will be pretty obvious in t5
you dont have haste and shit
quags has ICD
proc % doesnt really matter
BoW 15% proc chance, 50s CD
is that sunfire
for me its spellpower
whole game
im sure sims calculate this but i dont think soulfrost is worth if you are shadow
based on :feelcraft:
hit will be easy in t5
all items have it
putting t5 helm on any list is very unrealistic
its going to hunters/mages first
@Aloysius you use t4 helm+shoulders
btw can you still use boots / belt of blasting if you drop tailoring
boots is bop but doesnt say anything about tailoring
https://i.nuuls.com/WGZLk.png
so crafting boots and then dropping tailoring is possible?
thats the pattern
but you want to craft bracers in t6 anyway
you can check ICD and shit on wowhead
anyone on asmonlayer?
you have salv?
shouldnt have any issues with salv tbh
is your tank getting bloodlust?
why would you slowroll cod
it pops 1 min later
threat should be fine at that point
not really
i came into tbc with 900g
full spellfire+spellstrike and like 4k now
warlock is pretty cheap
compared to melees
what enchant recipe does he drop?
popping seeds wont be a problem in 25 mans
im pretty sure seeds dont pop each other
like if theres even one guy doing some kind of aoe
it will pop all seeds
it could be worth it if running optimal comp
10% less but also has 10% faster cast time
??? engi doesnt come better in next phase
enchanting is free 24 sp
yeah people will drop tailoring after making boots
but you gotta relvl it in t6
so idk
well spellfire gloves are t5 bis
so if ur fire never dropping tailoring probably
t6 tailoring bracers are bis right?
oh but its boe
https://i.nuuls.com/-lcTV.png
so dropping tailoring in t5 is viable if ur shadow
boots dont have tailoring requirement
yeah
you craft boots of blasting and then drop tailoring
not really
tailoring is useless until swp if ur shadow
and engi helm+t4 shoulders+t4 gloves could be bis if ur fire
just switch to bear mt once they have t4
problem solved
i dont see how you can have threat problems right now in 25 mans
are your hunters misdirecting?
do you have all phys debuffs?
i just looked at t5 gear, for fire locks t4 helm+shoulders+spellfire gloves seems to be best
and for shadow locks engi helm+t4 shoulders+t4 gloves
thing is warlocks arent getting any t5 tokens
mages and hunters
you lose spellfire gloves if u get engi goggles
so its not even good
for shadow locks sure engi goggles are bis
t5 helm+shoulders for m*ges
icon, fire + all dmg OH and then 100 badges for fire res set
i already have full badge fr set
was easy to get tbh
you can just put CSD on hood of oblivion
is MSD even good for seed set, you have to gem a lot of blue shit instead of yellow crit gems
csd with all yellow crit gems should be better
but if you were smart you already used green hit gem on t4 shoulders
so cant really put them on seeding set
i was thinking about it
but its not worth it atm
veiled noble topaz better
our guild has only seen warlock shoulders
last week dropped warrior ones i think
gemming for msd is just nightmare
msd also makes you go oom faster
which is a big problem when seeding
well it depends, if aoe capped focus on crit/haste
if not you want oblivion set
is crit trinket better than quags too then
people will actually now play DN because of u guys
good job
summoning imp for 10s after every pack
if they are 70s
just buy all the supply
in what instance can you farm flame caps?
need invis class?
i dont understand why do u guys want to healthstone cave in
theres 0 raid dmg after/before it
fire is always best personal dps
i didnt see a single DB in whole classic
didnt miss a reset until aq
https://i.nuuls.com/hYNmc.png
0 deathbringers seen
firelocks should have prio on shoulders
helm?
wtf
i got gloves and helm first reset
1.3k burst oh no no no no
why wouldnt you craft girdle of ruination
im planning on crafting it even though im using spellfire
mages going arcane doesnt matter
arcane/fire is better anyway
yeah mages are going arcane t5
but always should have one arcane/fire
???
dont people understand arcane/fire is a spec or what
mages going arcane literally isnt even a problem
no they wont outdps locks
they are drinking half of the raid
then he plays fire or arcane/fire
are people again forgetting arcane/fire is a spec
what do you mean most mages
if guild wants imp scorch, there will be imp scorch
if mage wont play arcane/fire
then he wont come to raid
simple as that
like even if theres 0 firelocks, arcane/fire is probably better raid dps
yeah sure arcane/fire
what do you mean
some guy just said mages will go arcane
not raid dps wise
you cant trust anything mages say lmao
they are unironically playing arcane right now
yeah will go shadow in t6 probably or swp
but every guild will run imp scorch in t5
theres literally 0 reason to not do it
why i shouldnt
because of improved scorch
tell me why does arcane/frost mage sense
other than ooming faster
:Pepeclown:
yeah just stack 5 druids and 2 spriests
then those mages will pump for sure
way worse?
and its all about raid dps dude
not about some "burst"
like mages thinking they are going arcane/frost in t5 is pure cope
they will be doing imp scorch because its better raid dps
good for you
you go oom faster
ur literally shilling arcane/frost here
and saying channel is shit lmao
i dont sim
i feelscraft
and mages themself have simmed it
fire is like 100-200 dps below
why would mage care about that
they are running arcane/frost in kara
with one arcane immune boss
?
how are they top overall
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/VxPD1jav87FXLKbc#boss=-3&difficulty=0
thats arcane top log
and doing 993 total
thats literally the top guy
thats the top guy
https://i.nuuls.com/4Gh4V.png
?
how is he not top guy
kara is the only real raid we have
with trash
why am i outdpsing the world top 1 arcane mage
?
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/d3w8jGMTAHJmx2XD#boss=-3&difficulty=0
kara is the only real raid we have
25 man content has 7 trash packs
1024 dps vs 993
whats higher
@Healspls 1024 vs 993
whats higher
i have to tap more
we are running with 5 dps
im just showing you the logs
where im outdpsing top 1 arcane mage
no the point is, arcane mage needs to drink
while real classes deal dmg
which means, arcane is dogshit on total dps
no shit they suck
look at my raid dps
its 3 healer+1 pala Ot comp
well the fact is
every decent raid will have imp scorch in t5
either from full fire mage or arcane/fire
i was right about t4 helm+shoulders thing
its t5 bis
you can have 0% hit and 0 crit from gear can hit/crit every spell
you replace spellfire chest&belt, with t5 loot
but spellfire gloves are bis
t4 helm is better because of CSD
because you lose dps
what kind of loot system do you use
and t4 helm should be already pretty free in karas
oh no no
if ur wiping a lot
flask is good option
1 flask is better tho
he could be 60% flying chad :pepebrain:
like me
wowhead comments say they dont stack
yeah fuck the spec that does more dps :pepebrain:
whats up with coping mages
and i dont understand whats wrong with mages
why wont they just accept that they will be arcane/fire in t5 and shut up
25 man fights favor hunters hard
have mages even theorycrafted if boomkins are better innervate target
or even locks
define good arcane
how many spriests, how many innervates
will raid stop after every raid pack
and wait arcane mages mana?
is this what mages arcane mage "good"
you need fire mage or arcane/fire mage if you want to play fire
so if your guild doesnt run / plan to run those specs just stay shadow
well every raid should have spriest
well true
every raid should have fire mage
but every raid doesnt have one
but every raid really should have a spriest
no
fire just does more dmg
so more threat
arcane/fire is a spec
mages griefing too
they are unironically playing frost or arcane/frost atm
you dont lose that much going spellfire
only lose frozen shadowweave boots
yea
in t5 shadow specialization is useless
well whole tailoring is useless for locks in t5
after you craft your boots of blasting
belt of blasting is boe
you craft boots of blasting and then switch to engi
if ur shadow
4set is worth it
you use both immolate & corruption with it
thing is
you are only losing frozen shadoweave boots from shadow gear
so theres really no reason to not go spellfire atm
well that depends
did he have spriest in raid
but not fire mage
so you had spriest ?
why does he have frostbolt icon
dst is really only good for hunters if they melee weave
yea mages will take off in t5 :Pepeclown:
:Pepeclown:
warlocks wont even show up on meters
just gotta take 30s drink break after every trash packs
and mages will PUMP
in speedrun environment mages just go pure fire
problem with melee is that its melee
!optimal
whats the command for optimal raid comp
you cant bring warrior tank in that raid
u need feral
frost mage should be fire
resto druid another shaman
but yeah holy priest / resto druid dead classes in speedruns
you just stack resto shamans
imp ff is very strong for threat
you have literally 0 hunters, ur tank needs to have sick tps
you probably should run arms warrior+feral MT
because you really need sunders
so threat doesnt suck ass
comp doesnt matter in kara
pumper shaman with innervates could maybe solo heal nb
druid mt
just easier to have ele shaman offheal i guess
why would you stack hunters
in raid with trash
so just stack locks
hunters need all the phys debuffs to pump
warlocks dont need anything
hunters want imp ea, cor, blood frenzy
not really
and if you bring 1 lock, you might aswell bring 2nd lock
for coe?
yeah with all debuffs and all bm hunters in same group
sure
but you cant bring everything in 10 man
https://i.nuuls.com/fyOPv.png
this should be pretty strong comp
nah feral kills the wyrms
Maintanks
or dps
nah
wyrms do nothing
how is spriest troll
resto shaman still needs mana
yeah
you just drag wyrms with you
and you kinda want spriest for mage too
so he doesnt need to drink
do you even need to kill wyrms?
probably can do slowfall tricks
cant cancel it
but you could have 1 guy do the pull and rest stay out of combat
so doesnt matter
you lose 1 min if all 10 do it
problem is, you cant cancel petri
ur sitting there 1 min in speedrun
why cant feral just pull everything to right
and solo petri there
i still dont understand why it doesnt count
its literally dmg
what makes it different from hunter pets
yes? its still damage
what makes it different from hunter pets
so should we remove CoD dmg from logs too
because other locks need to do cor/coe
and i dont understand the lust stacking argument
in later raids you really want to stack every lust to lock group
and encounters were balanced around it
so you shouldnt optimize your dps?
why do you care
parses are a meme
running warrior tank in t5 will be hard grief
warrior already have threat issues
will get even worse in t5
if you dont have pala
threat will be a problem
but every kara should have pala
yea
holy priest doesnt need spriest
saw my 4th one today and havent even ran it every day
:Pepeclown:
:Pepeclown:
thing is, oblivion set is bis
content will be prenerf right?
warlocks dont go for 4pc t5 tho
you dont want t5 head
shadow locks want engi helm
and if you use engi helm, u grab 2pc t4 with gloves+shoulders
yea fire uses t4 helm+shoulders and spellfire gloves
wboss gloves lose to spellfire probably
20 sp vs 20 hit
warlocks are never getting t5
just forget about it
smart play is to skip t5
and say t6 is warlock prio
no its not if you take t5 as warlock
prot pala should have first prio
but after that its warlocks
i wish i was orc male
too bad i chose fem orc on my summon alt :pepehands:
thats a good idea
let huntes trap the demons
@Gofu is that right :pepebrain:
:pepebrain:
wait im firelock
never mind
:pepebrain:
idk
thats 0 stam
0 int
doesnt boost immolate at all
you can de all the useless shit too
could be decent gp / h
i had that idea today after i saw i had 100 hit in seed gear
with 0 hit items
isnt arcatraz OH bis
no you want CSD
so you can stack yellow gems
MSD fucks with your gems too hard
and you should go 8 crit gems
pvp bracers have crit yeah
did mages infiltrate us again
you will be putting imp scorch up in t5
i actually enchanted my oblivion gloves with +15 hit :pepehands:
i guess its better for bosses still
does this even have 64 hit
is ssc/tk/bt/swp trash 72
or 73 like mags lair
2x veiled noble topaz
spellfire bonus is dogshit iirc
isnt it just +6 stam or something
no i mean gem socket bonus
i have blue socket in t4 shoulders and one blue gem in spellstrike
no
you want 12 sp gem in helm
you always wear spellstrike too
just put the blue gem there
it is
why wouldnt you put it in helm
and get bonus
for FREE
you dont get free bonus
if you dont have helm then its whatever
shattered halls drop 42 crit legs too
iirc
who cares about killspeeds
this is some horrible meme of tbc pserver community
if you want to "compete" speedrun kara
or wait for real 25 mans
t5 will have actual hard content if its prenerf
also longer raids
blizz just should push it out asap
furies still stomp everything
even without wbuffs
all casters get even worse without wbuffs
now they will run into mana problems
tanks can still taunt
firestone + oil is even better
yes it does?
firestones autoattack part is overwritten
uhh why wouldnt they use 1.5s cast for imp
how many lusts did they get
bm hunter does more dmg atm with 4 support classes
if you remove support classes
stack warlocks
pretty sure thats best raid dps
you cant trust anything mages say
they are unironically playing frost and arcane/frost right now
literal mental illness
hunter dungeon set is just busted
all 25 man fights favor hunters
in t5 warlocks become #1
@Healspls wrong
if you need runes just go farm demonic runes
why would hunter rage quit over dst
its not even good for them unless they melee weave
its best for rogues/furies
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/838485465908641802/858770682993049600/unknown-19.png
pretty sure haste isnt good stat for surv hunter
they want crit
skull is lock prio 100%
its literally their first trinket upgrade from raids
why didnt i go male orc :pepehands:
who cares about purple
brown is hardest color to get
just dont cast immolate :feelcraft:
so you cant fuck up rotation
does anyone know if 2 warlocks can juggle enslaved demon?
without DR
so if you have 2 warlocks
go grab dog in kara?
how long do you need to banish it
thats not so bad
2x banishes and 5 min pumping
demon dog is super op
problem is
he pulls aggro and probably dies on boss
did they have that heal talent shadow locks can get
if they are running 3 healers it could be useful
yeah thats the reason why they ran shadow locks then probably
3 healers is very low
but yeah arcane/fire is even worth it with 0 shadow locks
self heal?
gruul is 15s?
its not meaningless if ur running 3 healer gruul
everything helps
uhhh isnt fire just better for HKM
precast soulfire, one lock casts immolate and rest spam incinerate
well coe does like 40-60k dmg
so yes worth it
whats the difference between 300 raid dps and 300 personal dps
they will be switching to arcane/fire
if :Pepeclown:
uhh why wont you get mag chest anytime soon
ur not casting shadow bolt without isb
thats actual hard griefing
that depends
if ur aoe capped, you just want max crit
and haste
slippers is very good piece
hard to get more hit/sp from anywhere
will we actually just get one t5/t6 token per boss
is there badge arcane resist gear
no? fire mage is best spec right now
"fine" ? :Pepeclown:
best mage spec is "fine" ?
other than higher raid dps right @Aloysius
how is arc/fire bad atm
its better than arc frost
it bring scorch
needs less mana support
well some mages are playing shit spec without scorch atm
just forget about hkm lmao
what the fuck
what is wrong with people
t4 is a joke
just afk until t5
t5 prenerf content will be difficult
prenerf solarian should be difficult also
why would anyone force anyone to play resto
resto druid is the last class you want
dont steal 2nd ele lmao
unless you have infinite resto shamans
4th lock wants ele atleast
some guilds have resto shaman problems
so 2 eles for 3 locks
and 0 for the 4th lock
sounds smart
wait what dps do you even take
if you have 2 locks and 2 hunters
dude just transfer
leave that guild asap
dude if t5 is difficult
ur not clearing it
you want vashj chest+t6?
for me its shoulders because of sapph enchant
well it makes 0 sense to put resto shaman in hunter/feral grp
enha should always be in hunter grp
its waste anywhere else
put resto shaman there
no point in wasting bm buffs on resto shaman
or wasting enha buffs on meme classes
no? you run one enha
in hunter group
yes
enha shaman doesnt even want to use wf totem
you can run 2 enhas but why would you
if you gem everything with 8 hit, ur going to have too much hit dude
veiled noble topaz is best gem atm
2x veiled > 1x 9sp,1x 8 hit
well its a fact
they literally arent
why would i need to sim it
its literal basic math dude
ok
which one is better, 2x veiled noble topaz or 1x 9sp and 1x 8 hit
thing is, if you have one 9 sp and 8 hit gem somewhere in ur gear
2x veiled noble topaz would have been better
most casters also want rubies
only locks and fire mages really use veiled noble topaz
loot is based on guild ID or something
warlock shoulders every week, 0 warlock chests
yep dog from basement
you should only seed +4 targets anyway
if you have paladin in group you wont get interrupted
you should only seed imps if theres like 6-7 up
they do basically nothing
yeah i doubt thats possible
mage will be arcane/fire anyway
doesnt really matter
yep
mag is dream fight for furies
uhhh why are you asked to go demo
and you will be mainly casting shadow bolt as demo, spellfire gear doesnt sound a good idea
if they ask you to be demo, they should ask mage to be fire lmao
does anyone know whats optimal SpellQueueWindow for casters? im using 133 but i think its too low
should i go use 400?
i spam it
and still have small gaps sometimes
ill just test 400
well i have 37 ping but dont see reason to not play with 400
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/23vH9K8GRjfPNWgC#type=casts&source=6&fight=last&start=3227241&end=3265567&view=events
this was with 133
whoever gets hit
https://i.nuuls.com/BYSgg.png
this was our kill
someone just gets hit nothing you can do
yea it was 2m, had a scuffed comp
3 healers+1 pala OT
t5 will be hard dominated by warlocks anyway
who cares
looking at 25 mans is stupid
no one gives a fuck about current 25 mans
fact is t5 content has trash
which means warlocks will be #1
25 mans dont have speedruns atm
just wait for t5
hunters dungeon set is busted
probably main reason why they dominate t4 atm
hunters are better for mag tho
they lose less dps when they have to click
if you stack demo
you need phys debuffs
so might aswell stack hunters
just wait for t5
t6
swp
channelers should be dead in like 16 seeds
which is doable with consumables
imagine playing on meme servers
one boss drops one token
just pass t5
so you have prio on t6
it is debate between warlocks
if you have t5 but other warlock doesnt
whos going to get t6
mages never get skull over locks
sliver should be warlock prio tbh
no they wont?
they get trinket from ssc
warlocks get literally nothing until skull
sure thing
cant trust anything mages say
they are shilling arcane/frost & frost atm
no
fire does more dmg
???
on gruul fire is literally better
https://i.nuuls.com/jL-IG.png
how is arcane/frost better on gruul
tell me
in what raid?
idk what you call competing
and well played fire isnt that far behind on trash
with flamestrikes
no?
not playing fire now is literally griefing
1 token per boss
like 10 guys in raid want set bonus
just skip t5
arcane/fire doesnt oom really
well t5 weapons arent that big
if you have t4 weapon
i dont need sims
i just :feelcraft:
well the whole point of arcane/frost is to feed him everything
and if top arcane/frost mages lose to destro
whats the point
you could innervate moonkin,warlock or ele shaman
or healers
is it?
has anyone calculated it
vanilla innervate is different lmao
even with 2 warlocks in raid, arcane/fire is probably better
imp scorch is just too good
even in this phase its better to lust locks
wont be even close in later tiers
depends on ur server, but probably buy @Jin
no
always be casting
wowhead shows icd & proc chance
but its dogshit
no nexus horn is dogshit
warlocks never use cow wtf
normal demo is good enough
moonkin crit idol isnt ingame right?
gruul is decent fight for affli
what fight is that
1.2k is extremely low
brining affli isnt even worth it most of time
raid dps wise
no its not
sp is better
wtf
:Pepeclown:
sp is always better
https://i.nuuls.com/AAhvk.png
yep druids pump
answer is
fuck them
fire destro is bis
yeah have priests actually theorycrafted is casting mind blast worth it
in t5 mages so arcane/fire
idk whats the point of this discussion
doesnt really matter what mage wants
if guild was imp scorch
they will have one
is imp blizzard actually good in t5?
does the slow work on trash?
vanilla parses :Pepeclown:
even bigger joke than tbc parses
https://i.nuuls.com/eCF08.png
imagine losing to summon alt
ur top 67 mag?
idk t4 parses full joke for locks anyway
@Healspls whats ur character
?
way to cheese vanilla parses was stacking 20 furies
chainlust is nothing compared to vanilla cheesing
thats how parses work
faster you kill stuff
better parse you get
coe/cor always over cod
what
he unbanishes after adds die
never seen him unbanish with timer
belt of blasting is boe
you only need to craft boots
but if ur fire
spellfire gloves are bis anyway
@Aloysius kara isnt instance of 1 min fights, its 1-1½h fight
:Pepeclown:
how isnt SL good
so jc neck buffs are removed from everyone if you unequip the item?
and all 3 stack right?
kk
jade pendant of blasting
@psychadalic_cheet0s sure it is
moonkin should use it
its basically 83sp neck
actually even better because it boosts better dps classes
because of ruin
its pretty good talent
1 token per boss in t6 :pepehands:
trash is most important part of raid
with no wbuffs some guilds will actually be hardstuck on hard bosses
and prenerf KT & vashj should be very hard
naxx means nothing, most guilds rebuffed for hard bosses
maybe in dog guilds
we only rebuffed once whole naxx
salad bakers rebuffed on their gdkps sure
KT & vashj should be hardest content in whole tbc
if its prenerf
with wbuffs
no one took full wbuffs in original vanilla
yeah sure maybe with ony & zg
but its nothing compared to full buffs
yeah you could stack wbuffs in original tbc
was removed in 2.1 i think
summoning imp for 10s after every pack is "fun" :Pepeclown:
no
fire destro sacs imp
6s summons
1.5s every 15 min
sure you do :Pepeclown:
show some dn logs
aff in kara?
flasks are literally free
whats up with this discussion
in minmax discord
SSC BT should have been out day 1
with old attunement system
u guys want to do less dps?
instead of more?
uhh
vashj robe is lock prio
you shouldnt even want t5 tbh
just give it to meme classes
1 token drops per boss anyway
it could take months to get full set
like i havent seen a single t4 warlock chest drop yet
done every reset
nah
if you have fire mage
u gotta be fire
and just seed
@Lencovic did you know arcane mages can do imp scorch too?
yep
it will be meta
not really
they will be using fillers a lot
anyway
cod is way overrated
thats 3 globals
need to be close to boss
im saying it doesnt matter
if ur coe or cod
imp scorch for immolates
shamans
arcane pumps on trash if you drink 30s between every pack
thing is, seed is hitting 4 targets on moroes
AE is hitting 5
so ofc mage wins there
@Xelrog doesnt matter if u hit aoe cap
every serious speedrunning guild will stack locks
it wont be warriors
warlocks straight up deal more dmg
are ranged
dont need phys support classes
bm hunter is actual trash for beam
@Skycrab pretty sure they dont
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/WkvJ49bZ82hB6gtH#fight=last&type=summary
so why didnt hunters win here
malch is probably best patchwerk fight right now
oh so why is it lock favored fight
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/WkvJ49bZ82hB6gtH#fight=55&type=summary
ok explain this
both hunters had beam
why didnt they deal more dmg
mages abuse spellsteal on netherspite
nah
not really
warlocks really want ele
fire mage
not often
theres usually one ele in 25 man raid
1 mage in 25 man raid
people really dont understand arcane/fire is a spec?
@Helsa where do you hear it?
you cant trust mages
best mage spec right now is fire with imp blizzard
in t5 it will be arcane/fire
you can innervate healers
moonkin
warlock
ele shaman
innervating arcane/frost is fucking grief
nah
one fire mage is required
one rogue brings imp ea
its as valuable as fire mage
fire mage is required
if you dont bring one
ur griefing
@jpaint mobs have more armor
you dont understand how armor reduction works dude
@Xelrog arcane mages can scorch
and they will
because its more raid dps?
arcane fire requires less support too
its just better spec
not grabbing icy veins isnt even big on st
it loses like 100 dps
it is minor dps loss
running affli atm isnt worth it
will be better in t5
like you cant trust mage discord at all
they are shilling frost & arcane/frost atm
mages are literally in the same spot as in vanilla
3rd best dps
just wait for t5
when casters arent assfucked by mechanics
you dont really need to go shadow in t5
gear is almost the same
spec is same
going for 4 piece t5 is peak clown
literally one token per boss
mages want it
hunters want it
warlocks want it
engi head is only bis for shadow
for fire tailor+ench is better
its still 9% more crit dmg
t4 helm / mindblade
fire mage will be bis in swp
maybe even t6
sr does nothing
i tried tanking him
and got crushed for 8k
nah
salv is best healer utility
gl getting 4 piece t5 with EPGP
:Pepeclown:
yeah and i have seen 0 t4 chests
seen 0 weapons
done every reset
nah it shouldnt
FAP doesnt stop sap right
so is gruul mindsootheable
how?
and not trolling?
do u guys have video of priest doing it
my guild doesnt believe its possible
so its not possible?
whats his pull range
got clip of someone doing it?
or video
@Swope thats HKM right
doesnt look like these guys use mindsoothe on it
idk havent found a single video where its mindsoothed
yea found a log
@Ryusei you can actually buy vortexes in p2?
yea thought it was 2.4 patch thing
but belt of blasting is boe anyway
doesnt matter who gets the recipe
i dont think your guild is going to survive then
prenerf t5 wont be pushover
if its actually prenerf
where?
everyone knew vanilla was faceroll
P1 is free
clicking the cubes is hardest mechanic
and you only need 15 clickers even in boomer guilds
you kill it with 3 clicks
:pepe_atiesh:
well haste changes things
just cast incenerate
someone probably has immolate up
"needed burst stages" :Pepeclown:
its not mythic raiding dude
haste potion is melee only
or well physical dps only
he actually thinks he wont be doing scorches in p2 :Pepeclown:
not really
you want set bonus from shoulders
so one blue
just wait until theres like +5 imps before you seed
if there isnt +5 imps up
dont seed
its simple
better on ele shaman
have you seen gruul mechanics
@Jakey :Pepeclown:
what does isb have to do with anything
thats not a issue
you can have one lock do immolate
rest spam incinerate
what flame cap bug
:Pepeclown:
you shouldnt have 8% miss?
how does mage just switch?
do hunters randomly spec MM in ur guild too?
its just literally griefing
lowering raid dps because mage wants to suck all mana support?
if your mage doesnt bring imp scorch
its literally waste of raid spot atm
60 raid dps?
more like 300-400
+ on top of mage griefing his own personal dps
@yoey does alliance really?
are you sure
wtf
kara is fun
no
wait mag has debris?
never seen it
@Ryusei only with full ticks?
not many 4 target cleaves survive 15s
depends on how many warlocks you have
in optimal comps maybe get 2-3 seeds off
pretty sure they want helm+shoulders
4 piece t5 discussiong is pointless
warlocks are NEVER getting 4 pieces
even if t5 lasted 1 year
1 token per boss
is very brutal
tbh anyway based on my feelscraft
i would never use 4 piece on shadow
maybe on fire lock
uhhh
what do you mean
sac void
enjoy
cot is 30s duration
no its not
you dont even need to tank imps
they do literally nothing
aoe a bit if you want to pad
m*ges should be permabanned from here
so they cant spread misinformation
@Stabile did you really post clip with 3 anni stacks?
affli will be strong in t5
its another seed
arms is required
if you dont have warrior tanks (which you shouldnt in t5+)
arms is literally the last melee you replace
demo shout , thunder clap?
and if you think fury will be pumping without arms
ur delusional
and idk
you always bring arms
if you dont
why would u bring fury
oh it is?
you dont need warrior MT for anything
if people did it 17 years ago
we can do it today with no problems
no it didnt
pservers had viable annihilator
which is free 600 arp
in classic you wont have it
because it doesnt proc?
maybe if he wears full threat gear
but at that point you should just use bear
or pala
guys arcane/FROST mages will outscale warlocks for sure dudes
@Wrdlbrmpft every fight in t5 will be sub 40s?
mages never need to drink during trash right?
well you can drink during KT :Pepeclown: (thats how it worked on pservers)
yea the 2nd caster grp has resto/spriest
you never want to give them 5% crit
you always bring one mage for scorch
and int
you always bring moonkin
this guy is r word
you dont bring resto
you bring shamans
whoelse would bring imp motw
ok what about threat @jpaint
ur trolling right?
this guy is just r word
you always bring moonkin
i dont need math
i feelcraft
tanks still need to stay alive in raids
and keep threat
yeah just give resto shaman and spriest 6% crit aura :Pepeclown:
no it wouldnt
okay dude :Pepeclown:
pretty sure moonkin doesnt have infinite mana even with spriest
:Pepeclown:
moonkin is also the best jade pendant user
you just use felhound for extra dps
i dont think it can tank anything
well even if it has a taunt
:Pepeclown: i had no idea HKM has mechanics
yes but you can drink during boss fights on pservers
so arcane mages are viable
:Pepeclown:
no
thats where locks shine
:Pepeclown:
hes trolling right?
@Stronktusk idk but echo will win this tier
afflichads will shine in t5
a bit below destrolocks but bringing sick utility
its threat reduction for seed too?
but what if he has mags eye
:pepebrain:
farming procs with shadowbolts
am i really the only lock who made his summon alt main?
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1007#metric=dps&partition=1&class=DPS
summon alt in top 100 :Pepeclown:
just get spellstrike ?
should be cheap by now
what server are you on?
50g cloths and 100g primals on gehennas
:Pepeclown:
just get spellstrike dude
its worth it
what would you even do with epic mount
i dont have one either
tbc is raidlogging expansion
you do literally nothing in open world
thats based
lowers horde prices
nah
tanks need crafted res gear
doesnt stack with lust
but yeah PI should be used on locks
2 spriests is hard grief
thats like bringing 2 afflis but even worse
way worse
affli is way better dps
doesnt eat isb stacks
theres no t5 dagger
:Pepeclown:
pretty sure priests can use maces too
what isnt badly itemised for spriests
maybe if they are maintanking
haste is useless for spriests ?
they only want spell power
well its lock prio anyway
but if its 37% drop rate
wont be a problem
are these illidan drop rates bugged
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=32483/the-skull-of-guldan#dropped-by
44% on skull
how many items does he drop
t6 loot is so sick actually
well pets can get the JC neck buffs atleast
idk if they do anything
you cant get 99 on gruul based on personal skill
theres nothing to do
blizz should just add t5
???? you always take kings over wisdom
what the fuck
:Pepeclown:
salv > kings > wisdom
simple as that
kings is int
more mana
wisdom isnt that good either
kings is just better
for movement speed
how much ms does wisdom give?
how much ms does wisdom give?
movement speed
yea idk whats great about 10% more hp and mana
insane
are you insane
wisdom isnt "insane mana regen"
????
who cares about vanilla dude
if you get free taps in fight
or if you dont need to tap at all
wisdom is 0 value
in speedrunning you always take 10% more hp
????
we arent playing vanilla
tbc healers have infinite mana
hp is never needed until it is
no its not
what do you need sp for right now?
yea
what do you need it for
everything is oneshotted anyway, we have enough raid dps currently to kill muru
:Pepeclown:
salv > kings > wisdom
who needs wisdom
@Aloysius what content have you speedrun in tbc
ssc? tk?
bt? swp?
in classic ofc
no they arent
they literally arent even close to same
no it wont?
healer mana will be nonfactor
:Pepeclown:
no? biggest advantage was salvation
and then kings
no its not
this guy thinks wisdom made alliance better faction
no it wasnt?
salvation and kings were the reason
oh so you didnt grab dmt on warlock?
because hp is useless
so like i said
salv > kings > wisdom
i was right, you can apologise now
:Pepeclown:
speedrunner doesnt care about fire lock
:Pepeclown:
peak clown
yea wisdom is real insane
:Pepeclown:
it just does
wisdom is "insane" in speedrunning
no way you will have time to do 2 taps between pulls
no no but hes a speedrunner
he doesnt care about fire
he speedran in vanilla
that means hes the expert in tbc speedrunning too
@InsaneKane oh he will be going arcane/fire for sure
just like every mage will
well thats just pure mage cope
imp scorch is too good to not have
imp ea was used on bosses only too
yet every speedrunning guild brought one
if ur speedrunning
you will bring around 12 locks
well thats just pure cope again
if you dont see why warlocks will be the meta class
ur blind
sure in t6 or swp fury stack might pull ahead
but in t5 they will be dogshit
@SELENAfknGOMEZ why do you think they will do t5 and s2 at same time lmao
they need to push t5 out asap
when?
like 4 months ago
its old
now is now
How do these midsummer sausages work
do they stack with everything
@Seeks its not big dps loss
sausage has 14 days duration
should be real time
like chocolates
but havent tested
cant you just go grab it before speedrun?
cant even clear cellar?
btw do your arms warrior just decide to go furies too?
and rogue decide to spec out of imp ea
csd isnt 9% extra on demo
fire is always better personal dps
in swp you always have fire mage
fire and shadow is literally the same spec
same gear
just switch the sac
4 piece oblivion set is only good if u arent aoe capped
@Mortium so what should my blood fury + trinket macro look like?
:Pepeclown:
what does /cqs even do
no it shouldnt ?
its perfectly fine as it is
so dont have 5 chars
its pretty simple
you probably wont have time to raid t5 on 6 chars anyway
its basically no difference
shadow wants engi helm after boots of blasting (if blizzard doesnt make tailoring req for them) and fire wants spellfire gloves
do mages even want that tho
isnt spellfire super good for them
moonkin, healers, pala tank
warlock
imp
ele shaman
yeah sure
mages are going arcane/fire in t5
they are only viable personal dps wise
https://i.nuuls.com/U9KxV.png
wheres the dps difference
and you could argue gruul favors arcanes
they arent a meme
and top parses favor arcane
busted :Pepeclown:
how many sub 1min fights will we have in t5
sure
how many sub 1 min fights will we have
you cant stack mages
:Pepeclown:
you shouldnt stack warriors
you stack warlocks
sure
are we taking 30s breaks between every pack too?
are they doing insane overall dmg
@Skycrab ok time to post some logs
because its pretty hard to see whats best total dps class atm in kara
because theres no rankings
is it actually exactly 5 min to reset DR
just ask salvation
for them
didnt have problems with salv
conc aura from paladin is the only way
on top of destro tree pushback reduction
no its not
its for cleave
not really
fire is better
ptr is up?
when were goggles added originally
swp patch?
yea but first version
when were they added
are jc bop gems even in yet
:pepe_ree:
is someone actually raiding on ptr
these guys are just standing around
wait they are sheeping shit :pepe_atiesh:
why arent they seeding
885k hp on that mob
idk bros
this is looking like a warlock raid so far
like these packs alone
will make warlocks kings
literally made for warlocks
in 25 mans?
shouldnt have issues tbh
if tank is pressing buttons and hunters are using MD
is this supposed to be a good guild
https://www.twitch.tv/varbane
mag :Pepeclown:
:Pepeclown:
oh i have said about that multiple times to leadership
yep comp is a bit grief
???
who said this guild was good
why are they running warrior tank
pretty sure you can just nuke this boss down
with 0 mechanics
is this guy british
hopefully they can kill this boss
would be nice too see other shit too
perfect warlock fight
looks like we are winning bros
why are they even switching the form
just pop lusts
kill it?
kill it before stacks become a problem?
its 2.8m
oh
well that makes it a bit more difficult
pretty sure dad guilds will never clear this shit
that makes the fight harder
longer fight goes on , more chances someone will fuck up
ok gotta follow this guy
hes based
warrior tank stocks going down hard
cant crush hmmm
so druids pretty OP?
has anyone even killed hydross
do tanks 100% need res gear
looks like trash will be hardest part
and lady vashj maybe
yep
its warlock raid
its same as naxx
everything before that was just too easy
t5 is really the first real content in tbc
probably not
mag already got nerfed and its faceroll
hp nerf was 2.4 i think
@Aloysius it was nerfed
they changed p3 timers
thats a nerf
just like nerfing his hp to 4.8m from 8m was nerf
no?
no its not
they press coe
corruption
immolate
shadow bolt
how is that hard
literally same rotation as shadow lock rn
expect you have to do CoD on destro
shadow lock has rotation
keep up immolate,corruption and coD
no
you use corruption with 4pc t4
which you should have if ur shadow
@Timtom i can show you incinerate has 2.25 cast time
biggest problem right now is shadow gear is fucking dogshit compared to spellfire
in t5 it wont really matter if ur shadow or fire
if you have 3 mages in ur raid
its already over
max amount you can run is 2
@hockethelm what
theres like 0 difference on sb / incinerate mana cost
enchanting is better
Has anyone gotten to solarian yet?
this korean guy is struggling on trash
yea its real gimped :Pepeclown:
what bug?
:Pepeclown:
?
what bug
doesnt sound a big problem
yea its not a problem really
less aggro problems
And why are we assuming blizz wont fix the bug
autoshot bug was fixed pretty quickly
doesnt matter if you hit aoe cap
on some bosses for sure
ssc trash was literally made for seed
nah trash had shit load of hp
we all knew this
what
???
ur trolling right
literally dont even know tbc innervate is different than vanilla one
just stop posting
okay so how dont shaman and paladin profit from it
okay so you you dont know how innervate works
:Pepeclown:
takes one 1h raid to get runes for frost res
chest , wand , bracers
nothing else really
weapon if you dont have one yet
will s2 offpiece bracers be good?
is idol coming in next patch?
nice :Pepeclown:
boomie life is awesome
jade pendant of blasting and that idol
TLC is good too
TLC+crit basically
and haste
you have seen trash packs right?
warlocks will all be top
a lot of bosses have seeding too
which means warlocks are #1 automatically
:Pepeclown:
are you undercover mage?
or fury
actual insane cope
yeah thats why you just stack warlocks
warlocks require least support of all classes
yeah sure it could seem good
doesnt change the fact that warlocks deal more dps
and need less support classes
and arent melee
t5 trash actually has HP
you cant just run over it and kill it while running
like t5 is 100% warlock tier
t6 might be different
but then you stack furys
and bring 1 surv hunter
if warlocks arent meta
could be with full t6 bis
including glaives
but warlocks will be very strong too
and arent melee
require less support classes
ele isnt bad
its still strong
not really
its just one mage
which you always want
but playing shadow in t5+ isnt problem
its just dogshit in p1 because of shit crafted gear
affli lock is very strong
it has seed
:Pepeclown:
every raid has a spriest
always
unless you are doing some clown phys stack
?
ofc spriest is never in destro group
no because of arcane/fire
not really
not really
they just oom faster with IV
you cant trust mages
they are shilling arcane/frost atm
fire mage is straight up best spec right now
and will be in start of t5
before mages get 2 piece
and going arcane cucks your whole raid
no its not
fire mage is better
AND you need 2 piece t5
no its not?
you have to remember fire mage brings +15% to multiple people
and its competetive personal dps with arcane right now
arcane/frost isnt that much better on trash
arcane/fire can weave flamestrikes
it will be in t5
you just want as many warlocks as you can get
thing is shadow gets a good gear in t5
compared to t4
so its not a big deal to switch
biggest problem will be lack of flame cap
if kills are fast, fire will be a lot better
shadow and fire are exactly the same spec dude
you can be shadow on bosses where its better, fire where its better
fact is you still want imp scorch in raid
arcane/fire is better than arcane/frost simple as
people way overrate arcane mages atm anyway
fight lenghts in t5 will cuck them
@Seeks no thats copium
arcane/frost brings literally NOTHING to raid
atleast fury brings battleshout
but mages bring nothing
no?
arcane isnt even close to highest dps
https://i.nuuls.com/-0yIy.png
dont see many arcane mages
fight lenghts will cuck mages in t5
actual meme class
and what, will we take 30s breaks between every trash pack
so mage can drink to full mana
oh so arcane mages are mana positive?
well we all should probably roll arcane mages then
and just bring them
and packs wont be over in 10s
one giant literally has 900k hp and then spawns adds
oh so the only actual real bosses will be bad for mages
the ones most people will have problems?
dps check :Pepeclown:
:Pepeclown:
we are dealing enough dps right now to kill mu'ru
sims
:Pepeclown:
SSC and tk trash is lvl 72 right?
problem is
theres nothing to spend gold on tbc
like gold is literally useless
no its not
in retail main reason people buy gold is boosts
no one buys boosts in tbc because content is too easy
epic mount for what?
yea for what
you play game 2h a week right now
and spend 99% of ur time in instances
gdkp?
why would people sell loot for useless gold
why would i play pvp in this clown game
nah cba
im not crying
im just saying gold is literally useless
and theres literally no reason to buy it
it is a clown game
made by clown company
t4 for 2 months
actual fucking clowns
why didnt they just copy original tbc
t4 t5 t6 out day 1
timegated by attunements
bosses still drop only 1 vial
it would take a while to get 25
for most people
* they dropped 1 vial
they werent unkillable
but they only dropped one vial
smart people levelled their warlocks before boosts even were available
yep
i have fetish+motc
leveled in p6
pretty sure arcane mages use int flask
people starting to recruit warlocks now :Pepeclown:
blizzard could change it
dooming on gruul is cancer
rather stay at 36 range
i dont see price dropping
it will maybe drop in swp patch
demand will just rise
supply lower
unless bots start farming them
aim for 164 hit, get as much haste/crit/ap as possible
its pretty simple
:Pepeclown:
bringing melees to raid at all is griefing
you dont *NEED* hit tho
if people overaggro you its their fault
what do you mean by rerolling
talent tree is literally the same
you switch sac & gear depending on the boss
if you have imp scorch
nah
boots and chest arent worth
mages arent going arcane before they have 2 piece t5
which will take a long long time
unless ur super lucky
and?
fights will be longer in t5
going arcane is straight up griefing
oh so 15-20 min KT isnt long?
the only fight that matters in t5
not really
thats the fight most people will have problems
yes it will?
have you seen hp values
yea combined hp of 5m is pretty low on p3
it is
theres a reason why alot of people didnt clear KT prenerf
@bobo KT p3 has mechanics, and is literally just one phase dude
not really
most people even here wont clear it
before blizz nerfs it ofc
which they will do soon after people cry its too hard
no.
MSD fucks your gems too hard
are you sure
people here tested it
and it didnt work
i saw one discussion with one guy saying it worked, then other people tested it and it didnt work
sounds like its not even worth it
just use CSD
gdkp will suck even more in t5
because you wont be able to clear content
like most gdkps struggle atm
and gold is useless in tbc
you understand how wbuffs work?
and AQ was a joke anyway, and everyone knew it
but most gdkps wouldnt have cleared naxx without wbuffs
@psychadalic_cheet0s KT wont be trivially easy dude
you cant go grab +50% dps and +30% hp buff this time
you cant just ignore every mechanic because of those buffs
switching between oblivion & normal trash gear wont be fun
im just probably going for max crit set
and use it for trash
arcane/fire is the proper spec
@Seeks ur trolling right
every raid doesnt have resto druid
in fact its the worst healer to have
thing is arcane/fire doesnt lose anything at all compared to frost
and gives more raid dps
but first month every mage is going to be full fire anyway
because gl getting 2 piece
ehh its not a big deal
t5 isnt coming in 2 weeks anyway
@Seeks who cares about al'ar literally free loot
only KT matters in TK
and thats a fire fight
mages get helm+shoulders
and thats it
maybe after hunters have full set
nah
fuck mages
mage gains from 4piece are marginal too
why would arcane mage ever break spellfire
idk
mages are literally griefing rn
playing arcane
yes and barely beating fire mage with 1 lust :Pepeclown:
totally viable spec
:Pepeclown:
https://i.nuuls.com/0DK8K.png
actual clowns
well arcane mages arent going to be better in t5 fights
?
can someone permaban this guy
actual fucking clown
https://i.nuuls.com/0DK8K.png
explain to me
how is arcane mage better
how many 10s fights we will have in t5 seekr
like what?
what uses
dont need to when i can watch streams
no
fire lock wants spellfire gloves
its just how it was
t6 will drop 1 token too
?
no
theres a video of only one token dropping
https://i.nuuls.com/NWQkR.png
so why did they link only one t6 token
in world first illidan kill
or was it duplicate
bulwark+zhardoom+1x t6 token
@Seeks can you debunk this
@Louki
?
Can we get some answers
theres no reason to assume t6 will drop 2 tokens
if t5 isnt dropping 2
why didnt that video show 2 tokens dropping
if its supposed to drop 2 tokens
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmVyYeAivyY&ab_channel=Warcraftcinemaxx
And?
Yes
eventually t4 dropped 3 tokens right
but it drops 1 token in classic
idk, im not the one calling other people "unreasonable" without any facts
Yes?
so what, dont just say t6 will drop 2 tokens
even though theres 0 proof it will
right now its more likely its 1 token
no ZA is p4
BT p3
https://i.nuuls.com/4oNcb.png
this is archimonde loot
illidan video could have been duplicate token or illidan only drops one token
actually looks like world first KT dropped 2 tokens
so nihilum got duplicate t6 from illidan or he drops only 1 token
other bosses seem to drop 2 tokens
its nonfactor
but you want affli anyway for t5
you take every lock you can for t5
thats same as benching furies in vanilla
well they are pretty much
is it actually 5%
like real 5%
armor reduces dmg by like 70-80% right
And?
fire mages have flamestrike
blizzard could make boots of blasting require tailoring
they have done it for other items
thanks
And if you are going for burn strat on hydross
you could just ignore adds
and banish them or smthing
lady vashj and KT only bosses tbh
idk not so sure about engi
could see it being useful of morogrim
sappering one wave of murlocs but idk
how can it be hard
just stack warlocks
?
i dont see guilds selling boots of blasting patterns for a while
is it confirmed they will drop from trash?
wowhead says its boss drop only
idk probably will drop from some trash
comments say it drops from trash
https://i.nuuls.com/48jmt.png
mobs that drop boots of blasting patterns
totem range isnt tiny tbh
its also the knockback reduction talent
if you have warlock tanking, it should be destro 100%
its just for first few weeks
after that bear tanks it
100 badges wasnt a problem
literally do daily
idk guys
just cap fr
get some stam
some hit
and its fine
thing is you just want to kill boss first week
if you minmax, you have bear tanking him
juggle strat will be viable too later on
they will probably nerf KT
:pepehands:
cant have hard content in classic
threat seems bugged
but hp should be left as it is
was everyone doing best dps possible
was comp perfect ?
blizzard has changed a lot of profession stuff
would be suprised to see boots of blasting be changed
how often does the eye actually proc on prot palas?
so its spriest prio first
then whatever
yea pretty sure that doesnt happen anymore, but havent played shadow so idk
dont think scorch can resist either anymore
1.9k crit
thats big
you need your raid leader to tell when pop potions?
whats next
raid leader telling people to pop their cooldowns?
you will be most of time
on trash atleast
9 min nightbane
how
its not haste bis
wtf
sliver+skull is bis
sliver should be better for sure
but its m'uru drop so
until that you use hex shrune head + skull
just dont move :pepebrain:
this whole arcane bomb thing feels like pserver meme
sounds like a mage brain thing
33k?
thats low
its doable
need shitload of warlocks tho
feral tanks
hopefully it stays
but we all know blizz will nerf it
ffxiv already killed wow
we all knew blizz will nerf it
it wasnt impossible
you just needed perfect comp
and good playing
like i said, we all knew blizz would nerf it
cant have hard bosses in classic
so what
adds should have had 1.5m hp
because it would have made game fun
:Pepeclown:
well KT was hard
and blizz nerfed it
because casuals wouldnt be able to clear it
now its , zone into raid
grab ur free loot
wait for swp
yeah KT was hard
and blizz nerfed 50%
ofc its easy after that
you got some proofs?
thats 2.3
blizzard just didnt put 1.5m randomly
:Pepeclown:
current KT isnt hard
it was hard when adds had 1.5m
now its you zone in and grab ur free loot
?
ofc
look at how many warriors my raid has
do you think we seriously speedran?
on horde
yeah we are casuals
oh nihilum minmaxed
:Pepeclown:
everyone just wanted prenerf bosses like blizz promised
but ofc it was a lie
oh but it was hard prenerf
no one killed solarian prenerf
and they had wbuffs
it was hard with 1.5m hp
you cant deny it
which is why blizz nerfed it
cthun was 100% killable prenerf
??
you know there are undocumented changes
right
are you trolling me
if you think fight nerf to solarian was 2.1
ur braindead
they did?
ur actually retarded right
?
"TBC Patch Notes"
where does it say anything about undocumented changes
https://i.nuuls.com/2V9VJ.png
okay
explain to me
why did guilds just randomly start killing it right after 24.
after they had been stuck on it
for + month
https://i.nuuls.com/mIRX9.png
not stuck on alar
solarian wasnt killed prenerf
simple as that
https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Guild_progression_(TBC)/TKE
literally the same thing happens with KT
its nerfed
then everyone kills it
prenerf solarian wasnt killed
no?
it wasnt killed prenerf
https://wowwiki-archive.fandom.com/wiki/High_Astromancer_Solarian?oldid=602679
https://wowwiki-archive.fandom.com/wiki/High_Astromancer_Solarian?oldid=612583
why do these have different abilities
depending on days
blizz changed the fight (nerfed it) and after that people started killing solarian
so explain the wowwiki abilities on 22. april
and then later on 30. those are different
https://i.nuuls.com/H_DrU.png
from KT reddit thread
none of those changes are documented in this "Documented & Undocumented changes" doc
Yes?
You know people used to play this game 15 years ago
they would notice those changes
fact is
solarian wasnt killed prenerf
KT wasnt killed prenerf
You can see the exact same pattern
Ur blind right
"Reducing High Astromancer Solarian's hp to 3.4m from 4.55m"
Those patch notes dont have anything about murloc hp change
what wording
didnt find anything with murloc or morogrim
And scolding dmg change doesnt seem to be documented either
Yeah found the lady vashj persuasion thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWDOkWp952Q&ab_channel=MethodClassics
atleast in this video murlocs die super fast
dont they have 70k hp in ptr?
murlocs have 70k hp on ptr
and theres no way those murlocs have 70k hp that youtube video
https://i.nuuls.com/vEe9y.jpeg
so jokerdtv's UI is bugged
or did they nerf morogrim already
And it takes a while for them to kill those murlocs
with pretty heavy aoe comp
ofc it does
if mob has less hp
its nerfed
so they actually nerfed morogrim too?
yeah reducing murlocs hp from 70k to 21k
isnt a nerf
:Pepeclown:
has anyone killed morogrim recently
on varbane's stream 4 days ago
murlocs have 71k hp
not sure if they have nerfed them after that
okay so murloc hp change was then undocumented everywhere
because theres no way those murlocs have 71k hp on method video
dots dont remove ISB stacks
mages go arcane/fire in t5
arcane/fire makes leotheras safer :pepebrain:
i just dont see arcane/frost being viable
with fight lengths we will have
and?
just because TBC pserver players never did any math doesnt mean its not good
did anyone test out bear tank on leotheras yet
or juggle strat
short fights like ????? in t5
i dont think you can drink on this server on KT
Idk about morogrim
yea spamming frostbolt is very easy, but whats the point of going arcane then
depends on how many healers you are running
if ur speedrunning, that number is as low as possible
@myri91 dude you always want to cast immolate...
especially as fire
like if survivability is a problem, then you cant run any other classes than warlocks anyway
so idk
shoulders+helm/gloves
we wont, because then other classes will just die
so it wont matter
it has to be dps increase with 4set t4 tho
:Pepeclown:
cloak & neck never drops
but i have HKM cloak so whatever
he resets aggro a bit after he lands
9k is max
if ur right on top of someone
well salvation still affects sapper right
so should be safe
yes arcane is very good on 20 min fight
:Pepeclown:
strong doesnt mean much
when warlock is stronger
raid cant support 3 arcane mages
no you cant
sure they can spam some frostbolts
but idk whats the point of going arcane at that point
it isnt?
:Pepeclown:
love these mage shills
saying they dont need any support
and this is why you cant trust mages
they are literally griefing raids
mag isnt even long
its short compared to t5 fights
how many 3 min fights there are in t5
lets talk about 3:55 fight
or 5:30 fight
@Seeks what do you mean?
do you think mages will outperform locks?
ur actually delusional
If you think mage will outperform lock t5 ur actually delusional
thats all
@Seeks ur actually delusional, do you understand how hard mag cucks warlocks
mag is actually the worst warlock fight in whole game
grull isnt mage unfriendly?
arcane mage gains so much from 5 target aoe compared to other classes its not even fun
not from 5 mobs
warriors want 4
you would replace spellfire in t5 anyway
they will be pressing imp scorch like everyone else in t5
they are just coping
they arent
if we are looking at raid dps
arcane mage brings nothing to the raid
fire mage brings something
how many of those top parses are arcane fire
oh
what makes arcane fire unviable next phase
:Pepeclown:
when most guilds start stacking more warlocks
what makes arcane/fire worse
like?
and dont say morogrim
warlocks are straight up the hero class in t5
yea fire warlocks are so bad on aoe capped fights
:Pepeclown:
not really?
fire lock just switches sac
presses shadow bolt
hunters alrready peaked
they are support class now
not really?
warlocks will be top 1 dps while bringing support
and mages will be scorching
forever
???
why should i get banned here
im not the one trolling
facts like what
?
are you comparing current content
to t5
or what
dont you see how different fights are
they are switching sac for free loot boss?
damn
dont worry arcane mages, im sure you can drink during KT
like on pservers
hunters already peaked
in t5 warlock stack is bis
going shadow wont even be a big deal in t5
locks get prio on vashj robe
its cool
jannies do nothing here basically, those are best kind of mods
no they flamestrike morogrim adds
and keep scorch up
do you have link to the clip
nice
moonkins will be competing with hunters t5
will be nice to see whos the winner
2 or 4 piece?
hmmm
who do they share tokens with
:pepebrain:
so moonkin prio
which pieces do they want
everything but chest?
vashj chest has to be warlock prio tho first
and they actually keep it until t5?
until swp*
i dont think tanks will need more mitigation
@Juff BT t6 pieces or swp pieces
nah
warlocks are never getting t5 4pc
only 1 token will drop
for affli it makes sense to keep 4pc t4
fire is for sure the best spec for 4pc t5
ogre magi cloak seems to drop every week anyway
and you will be running gruul forever
so its not a problem
wtf
i have seen it so many times
but only one sword
moonkin aura is pretty busted too tbh
no its not
no its not
hunter gains nothing from ele shaman
moonkin is 6% crit
isnt bm buff 3%
if ur not bringing moonkin
ur not bringing resto druid either
lmao
if we start talking about cutting moonkin, ur raid is full of whatevers the best dps+shamans
it did
everyone ran 6% hit
but problem was, most good pieces in vanilla had hit
so sometimes you went over 6%
shamans will be best healers later ingame
if they arent already
so why dont we have moonkins tanking leotheras
:pepebrain:
even with god tanks you need to chill early
and that god tank needs to be feral
yea im pretty sure prot warriors dont want t5
question is, does warrior need t5
probably not
how many warlocks do you have
uhhh
then you should be destro
in ele group
what
gquit
stacking ele is pretty much never legit
yea
no?
destro is far ahead
but yeah u really should just gquit that guild
theres noway thats real
ele shamans actually stacked to same grp?
how many groups dont have 100sp totems
like 2?
actual grief comp
dude just gquit
find a new guild
do arcane mages want 4pc t5 ?
or only 2 piece
which pieces
chest warlock prio :pepebrain:
and idk
hit is literally wasted
on vestments for arcane mages
do they keep it in t6
what was the mount hyjal ring called, and is it confirmed we can complete it in p2
what was it called
question is how many hunters will raids even have
:pepebrain:
nah
number is 0-1
once people see how long they will be in raids, they start to look at trash dps very quickly
and hunters barely show up there
you cant be a "mediocre lock"
literally press 2 buttons
personal skill didnt matter at all in vanilla
it was all about how many furies ur raid had
crit & haste > sp
in most cases t5
its around 40%
locks lose a lot more from clicking
and also p1 assigns cuck them hard
:Pepeclown:
why would you be demo without felguard
just go destro
:Pepeclown:
stop clowning
demo has felguard
if you want ruin go destro
nah
demo doesnt sound like a good idea for t5
even hunter pets are dying pretty hard
Who should be prio on sextant
mages dont want t5 legs
?
:Pepeclown:
thats not going to happen
are mages sure they wont want spellfire gloves
are mages 100% sure, mag gloves arent better
or is spirit good stat
like mages being arcane/frost over arcane/fire ?
many such tales
fire is even more pog
like what?
tidewalker?
ur aoe capped on morogrim
no?
ur easily aoe capped
you could argue fire is even better
because it has more crit atm
arcane explosion? :pepel
mages are on blizzard duty
mages will be top 1 dps guys
sure in swp
with glaives
but before that warlock is #1
yes you do
its 5-6 min fight
what else are you spamming
you spam AE and arcane blast
both oom you
so
we take 5 min breaks every pack
so mages can drink to full mana and wait for their CDs
morogrim is very extended thing
@InsaneKane from where?
so :pepebrain:
4pc t5 fire lock is meta?
they will nerf t4 content right
mogrom will be very hard for guilds if they have scuffed comps
more mages and warlocks easier it will be
What exactly will be nerfed in t4
so doing gruul with like 16-17 people should be easy
yea but even easier
hkm might be hard with 10
wotlk :Pepeclown:
classi wotlk will be the biggest flop
have fun farming naxx 25 min for 6 months
im out
just stop coping
roll fury in wotlk
but that expansion will be dead
seed is very easy to aoe cap
there was a way to check who parried the boss
a lot of trash is aoe capped anyway
and you can just use shadow sac
it was common sense to stop being demo in t5 tbh
just go destro
guys
anyone got link to mage discord
:Pepeclown:
not really
like sapper might be useful on one boss in SSC
arcane bombs work?
belt of blasting is boe tho
only need one drop
is there a sim for TLC
if its worth it on morogrim
doesnt TLC go to main target
if you target morogrim
should it him right
like if you have disc priest
you could have another shaman instead
isnt it good for druid tanks
for some mechanics
i dont think you can trust sims with haste
just gotta feelscraft it
leotheras doesnt melee in demon form right?
who cares
pressing doom is cancer anyway
owl isnt that big loss
2 tokens and everyone is bis in 2 months
its no problem
t5? nothing really
t6? skull
i doubt you will make money crafting belts
nether vortexes will be hard to get
it is good and a lot of meme specs want it
but its lock prio ofc
:pepebrain:
tbh
i expect a lot of gquits over skull
atiesh cucks get zhardoom
:pepel
this server really needs :PepeLaugh:
gdkp is literally dead system in tbc
gold is useless
spriest skull
thats a gquit
haste is good?
no.
its warlock item
what
mark isnt that big over eye?
pretty sure it is
eye is overrated
nope
you can just kill them right
theres shitload of downtime
feels like keeping adds alive just makes fight harder
why wouldnt you just kill them
free up the tanks to do what?
sit and afk
idk
what i watched streams
adds literally did nothing
and they just CC'd them and afked
how much hp do they have
20k?
lmao just kill them
20k thats like 3 globals
from 1 person
or will they instantly spawn again?
or just in next phase
and?
if mobs have 20k hp
just kill them
no need to make fight harder
but you cant make boss come up faster right?
so you just sit there and do nothing
idk guys
this sounds like some 17 year old tactic
just kill them
depends on their hp value ofc
but just kill them
does anyone know how much hp lurker ranged adds have
it is
well 57k is insta death
if few casters or hunters focus it
idk
just kill them is the easier strat
locks can insta coil and shit when they respawn
and what if it breaks when lurker is up
like i said
this sounds something like what they did in real tbc
when 1/4 they had of our raid dps
they use t5 chest
fire mages arent a spec in t5
like almost all of loot mages want is literal dogshit
let them have it
moonkins want 4pc t5
moonkins use spellstrike right?
legs
can someone link
cba to join every class discord
???
moonkin is probably the best support dps
idk about that dude
depends on how many phys dps you have
depends how hard moonkin pumps
and its still 6% crit to everyone in his grp
6% crit is pretty big
its FF with 100% uptime
dont need to cuck resto druid or hope ferals FF doesnt resist
you always want moonkin
simple as that
its still armor reduction
if you dont have moonkin
whos going to FF
feral has CD
if you dont run moonkin
you dont run resto either
no its not
if you start minmaxing
you remove all non shaman healers instantly
jpaint is just a troll
you always bring moonkin
idk u guys are delusional
if you think moonkin isnt worth it
EVERY GUILD WILL RUN MOONKIN
actually trolling
like
who do you think is going to FF
if not moonkin
feral with 6s cd?
and 16% miss chance
no need for math
you always bring moonkin
Now calculate FF with 100% uptime
vs FF with not 100% uptime
that depends
how much is combat ress worth in raid dps
innervate
FF with 100% uptime
6% crit aura to 3x locks+ele
moonkins get crit idol in next phase
so aura is 6%
it is bis
uhh
why would you ever play affli if you dont take shadow embrace
what item
staff is mage prio
always
no
its mage
arcane mage specifically
its just common sense
just like vashj chest is lock prio
skull is lock prio
only clowns enchant sunfire
40sp whole game master race here
40sp is just better
dont need to ever switch weapons
idk about that ryusei
magus blade has a lot more crit
idk that means you need to oil 2 weapons etc etc
easier to just have one weapon with 40sp
if you need to cast any shadow bolts in pack
wizardry is griefing
well it has more sp too
like i hav said earlier
you cant sim haste
you need to feelcraft it
spellfire gloves are still bis p2
gl getting wboss loot on non dead servers
and its close tbh
hit isnt that valuable in t5
you get it a lot from bis pieces anyway
not on fire locks
helm+shoulders
and spellfire gloves
it wont matter really
gear cap closes in t5
so its whatever
shadow rotation is easier anyway :pepebrain:
start with immo and after that just shadow bolt
not really
immolate is barely worth it
if you dont have imp scorch
meh
its really only good on opener
so you dont pull aggro with fat shadow bolt
@Ryusei i dont understand how movement would make immolate better
Yeah but it doesnt matter
if shadow bolt onaverage does more damage
cant cast immolate either can you?
you still casted it when you were still
its all about which deals more dps per cast
shadow bolt or immolate
movement has nothing to do with it
its not "pretty good"
if you have imp scorch
ur fire anyway
whoever made DN a thing should be permabanned
you cant quest with VW sac destro?
and idk
why would you quest
just hardcore raid log
ffxiv is better game anyway :pepebrain:
idk guys
gold is literally at all time low
just buy it
idk
1k / 11e is pretty cheap
nope
if you need gold just buy it tbh
but why would anyone need it
theres a reason why its all time low
i havent bought gold in tbc
and came into tbc with 600g
I made shitload of money with alch tho
but now its dead
:pepehands:
just do cloth CDs
primal CD with mastery
yea
i have 2 cloth alts
thats 100g every 3 days
takes 1 min per 3 days
yes it does?
i dont have to play this game
1 main
1 68 mage alt
idk
why would you have 2 characters
its classic
split raiding is waste of time
how can you enjoy this game
blizzard has made every single possible mistake so far
they could have
it is dying
thats why blizzard is pushing 5 out early
like what?
25 mans take 20 min if you just want to kill them
kara is 1½h
t5 was supposed to come out 6 months after release
according to blizzard timeline
warlocks wont even be tanking leotheras
so idk about this 100 badge discussion
i had FR set week 2 i think
or week 3
warlock tank can just die
if they get unlucky
having melee tank is safer
hard casting corruption doesnt sound fun
and fire is just better for 4pc t5
feels like blizzard designed it for pala tank
boss is even demon
a lot of guilds will use worse tactics yes
depends on server
atleast on gehennas its barely worth it to craft even with mastery
right now mats are 6g more expensive than flask itself
on gehennas
you add AH cut to that
and its not probably worth it even with mastery
you felt alive when you were grabbing flower
wbuffs were fun on fury
you were pumping
then you died
and now you deal 50% less dmg
Grunt Hannusumm
cant beat that
how does SE work
does it really reduce damage by 5%
idk
why wouldnt you take SE if ur affli
mage >  hunter > warlock
you can run 3 caster groups
but most guilds carry around too many melees
yea but its optimal next phase tbh
most guilds run meme classes for gear distribution
feral dps wont be decentish next phase
like fury will be probably the only melee that shows up on total dps meters
and they will struggle on some bosses
fel reaver has 8k armor etc
well it is
well it is anti melee in tbc if they cant hit boss 100% of time
not really
locks get free taps
i wouldnt call KT melee friendly
you literally cant dps caster add
i killed cthun with frostbite+bsh
:Pepeclown:
was #1 prio on crul and DB
was 30 nefarians until i saw crul
+60 onyxias and never saw it
boots of shifting nightmare are very good too
for shadow locks
idk
affli lock usually doesnt have ele shaman
so hit is very good stat
guys i need redpill on sextant
whats the prio on it
yeah but is it bis for anyone
eles think quags eye is better for them but i doubt that
its not even close to 300 dps
more like 100 dps
thats mages in ssc
making more run water
if ur raid has 2 shadow priests
isb uptime is ruined
if (when) ur raid has 2 mages
its better for one of them to go arc/fire
ISB affects all shadow dmg
all wanding is banned
isnt like every wand shadow
wait
imp scorch boosts sapper dmg then too?
i think we solved the puzzle
arc/fire is bis
like melees can just sapper hydross adds
etc etc
isnt it more with CSD
?
mages wont be doing 2400 dps in 180s fight
lmao
what dps loss
mages have infinite mana
and dont need to use fillers
:Pepeclown:
you can always just ask for another innervate
no it wont
affli has better seed
it will be close
and any warlock will beat any non warlock class
thats the real hardmode
they get to see all mechanics
thaddius has enrage?
lock isnt free
2 unlucky hits in a row
and ur dead
few resists on start
few people dead
other than being safer?
more dps?
ofc it is
faster boss dies, less chance people fuck up
yea go for cap and literally take anything but suppression
because theres not really anything else you can take
raid wise
did paladins figure out yet they can tank leotheras
that its optimal thing to do
its atleast 4 vortexes / week per raid you run
in 2 months no one is going to need them
if its 5 from SSC alone
no one is going to need vortexes 1 month in
uhh
how does that math work
does the haste snapshot at start of cast or what
no idea
you always want atleast 5 shamans
7 is max you can realistically bring
idk
raiding t5 with 3 dps warriors doesnt sound fun
most guilds will actually struggle on KT
especially if comp is scuffed
and biggest problem with melee dps is they fuck groups so hard
if you bring even 1 too many
8 yard
whats up with every guild trying to cuck warlocks
well its just better strat
safer, more dps
tanks can soak too right?
no
chaos blast radius is 8 yards
normal tanks can tank it
melees can dps
radius is 8 yards
its very low
depends on how t5 works
should be bis for fire atleast
t4 shoulders
no dont do that
put it to t4 shoulders
you replace spellstrike pants
with t5 pants
check the stam difference
you could argue t5 is bis
because of stam
tbh its not a big deal, you can always get another one
demolock would probably use t5 helm+legs
and depending on how set bonus works, it could be fire and shadow bis
especially fire bis
is it tauntable
Yep
what about it
yea better to lust vulnerability
hunters lose a lot less from clicking compared to warlocks
so warlocks should be last
t4 legs
wtf?
im pretty sure t4 helm+shoulders would be better
idk
destruction holo-goggles gem bonus is actually dog compared to t4 helm
pretty sure t4 helm would be better
with real legs
idk
running to sapper range
instead of just seeding
not worth
sure could be good on morogrim
but literally 1 fighjt
>has real weapon
>complaining about loot rng
engi tailor?
enchanting is always bis
JC doesnt become better afaik
wotlk is doa
:Pepeclown:
thats the most :Pepeclown: take i have ever seen
if we had "proper content"
24sp would beat everything else
no
you said "proper content"
https://i.nuuls.com/YKfN6.png
https://i.nuuls.com/4dJN3.png
idk guys
24sp+ amulet of unfettered magics looks a lot better
@zip that neck also has +24sp
isnt sunfire robe better
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/esePnHL7yxRgd59SnQVjXU
isnt this 100% bis
it just defaulted to human
how does that math work?
:Pepeclown:
it is a bit below cap
idk
more haste = better
simple as that
no need for these breakpoint spreadsheets
are those actual important breakpoints
feels like very minimal thing
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/wNtgBvYDBbsG5wCHLWFfRi
actually this might be the bis
539 haste 🤤
how can it be waste
i dont understand
unless ur hitting gcd cap(if its fixed) with lust
how does bloodlust and haste rating interact?
if you have 619 haste rating(with drums) thats 1.79 shadow bolt cast
when ur bloodlusted is it 1.79*0.7
well atm theres no gcd cap
but if its 1.79*0.7
ur not hitting 1s anyway
no you arent
629 haste rating is 1.79 cast
isnt lust 30%
so 1.79*0.7
1.253
not even close to gcd cap
539+80
619 haste rating with drums
yea
539 haste from gear
+ drums
thats 619 haste rating
so 1.79 cast time
then you add bloodlust
which reduces it by 30% ?
so its 1.79*0.7
and 1.79*0.7 is 1.253s
so its 1.37s?
yea ghostowl
gcd cap atm is 0.75s
and its supposed to be 1s
im pretty sure theres no magical cap at 500 haste
hitting 1s with shadow bolt seems pretty hard
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/wNtgBvYDBbsG5wCHLWFfRi
i dont think this set wastes any other stats
well its 5 hit rating
no way to fix it
9sp and 9 haste rating for 0.6 crit
well 0.6 crit rating isnt going to change anything either then
sapph enchant
:Pepeclown:
yea ring is boe right?
https://i.nuuls.com/GF_Q8.png
guys
looks like tear is swp bis
will be fun to wear eye of the night and chain of twilight owl in swp
:Pepeclown:
atleast moonkin doesnt need to wear jade pendant anymore at that point
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4302sPx4k-U&ab_channel=Tanknspank86
found a great youtube channel btw
dont hunters tank those?
even mage would be better tank probably
no if ur demo, cast shadow bolt
you can immo spam 4 targets
its close to seed anyway
you could see it week 3-4
double tokens in t5 will help a lot
just be fire
:pepebrain:
idk parsing in this game is meme
sometimes you have 20% crit
sometimes +40%
its not impossible to parse 99 with atiest wtf
im still using literal stormcaller and parsing 99
well having a weapon vs not having weapon is pretty big
literally all top 10 parses have raid weapon
gruul is actually impossible to parse 99
unless ur killing it with 1 shatter
worlds 2nd fastest prince, top 386 :Pepeclown:
sure feels good parsing in this game
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Vm1NzxQ7BgkPGdpX#fight=106&type=damage-done
im even top dps
and top 386
:Pepeclown:
just dont have fire mage/moonkin
pretty far
but need mind soothe
not far at all
raid loot is seeded based on something
so calculating odds assuming its fully random doesnt work
you dont bring a rogue if he doesnt do IEA
and it boosts rogues dps too
IEA is always worth it
unless ur running full caster comp
it does
IEA boosts his dps also
like all armor pen does
literally 0 reason
fury does more dmg and more utility
if rogue doesnt Imp ea
idk if threat will be problem in t6+
for furies
you could replace them with rogues i guess
threat isnt a issue now
or in t5
but it could be in t6 and swp
tbh 5 legs arent a problen anymore
youll get it soonish
wasnt taunt changed in tbc
to use normal hit
mag heavily favors pet class
demolock should be #1 on it tbh
you always click if going for good time
because you have 5 click groups
what
succubus eats ISB stacks
its not worth it at all
succ doesnt do "way more dmg"
FG is better on cleave
ruin does nothing for seed
succubus eats ISB stacks
you can dps eggs as fire?
so be shadow until weapon phase
switch after that
what?
al'ar looked easy as fuck
just split
KT will for sure kill a lot of guilds
but not other t5 bosses tbh
spout is literally the first mechanic
in tbc
they changed al'ar?
time to cuck furies/arms warriors? :pepebrain:
so
if its random
how many tanks do you need
warriors and ferals can just charge too?
so shouldnt be that bad
aoe was bigged on pservers
sure its possible
but pservers being wrong is more likely explanation
tbh shouldnt matter
8 yards is pretty small
no it wont
why would anyone carry shitters for useless gold
and gdkps arent going to kill KT
so ur gonna run with 3 buyers?
like almost every gdkp killed sapph+kt wbuffed
you wont have wbuffs this time
make an alch alt?
moonkin is very good utility
100% uptime on ff,combat ress
well if ur cutting moonkin your raid wouldnt have resto druid either
yeah rest of the expansion will be 20s-1min fights
:pepebrain:
arcane will pump hard
hxh will be hard tbh
low drop chance, every caster wants it
why would you pug it
instead of running with guildies?
it shouldnt optional
wait ZA is 3 day?
thats big
chain fear doesnt sound a good idea at all
just let melee cleave them
and shaman
well TLC isnt bad for ST
its probably best morogrim trinket
i havent simmed it either :pepebrain:
cant be bad tho
using healthstone is hard because it shares CD with flame cap
cant you just make hunters arcane res tanks
problem is ur tank is doing too low threat
do you have salv
then your tanks suck
unlucky
MD fixes a lot of pull issuses in 25 mans
would be big problems without them
who cares aobut being hit capped? :Pepeclown:
its all about what dps number you have on meters
in some cases its not even optimal to get hit cap
because of haste
yea
4pc to mages
prioing 2pc to every mage first
then hunters
2pc mage > 4pc mage > 4pc hunter
mages use any pieces but gloves
idk
illidan seemed to drop 2 items
1 token per boss would have been brutal
literally slower gear progression than vanilla
idk
imp blizzard will be probably meta
yea mages have infinite mana and dont need to cast fillers anyway
so should grab imp blizzard
idk
most guilds will run atleast 2 mages
so should have one arc/fire
god i wish cos and coe wasnt combined
you could cuck mages
kings wisdom motw fort on imp plz
and keep it shielded
:pepebrain:
you start with curse -> immolate -> spam shadowbolt for rest of the fight
arcane isnt even worth it in speedruns tho
not really no
bosses literally dont matter in speedrun
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/PLMCcgHpKJYB9FGj#boss=-3&start=0&end=2722924&type=summary
what?
how is that top dps
tell me
fastest speedrun doesnt matter?
okay
i guess arcane is worth it in speedruns
so go and beat them
stop coping
no one will take arcane mages for speedruns
https://i.nuuls.com/HPZxo.png
yep thats what you call own
2nd warlock would have been so much better
:Pepeclown:
yea thats bis melee grp
and caster grp doesnt even have shaman
they probably did big pulls before moroes
used blizzard there
arcane mages dont have infinite mana dude
even though mage discord seems to think they do
you dont have time to drink when speedrunning
?
can someone ban this guy
u do
hes just another idiot who thinks mages have infinite mana
in this speedrun you lost  alot
he probably thinks arcane/frost mages arent taking imp blizzard in t5
:Pepeclown:
yeah the mage
yeah u run 2 mages tbh
one arcane/fire, other arcane/frost with blizzard
so
hunter tank for leotheras? :pepebrain:
tfw precast soulfire crits
only needed 50% crit chance for 99 gruul :pepebrain:
fights dont favor t5
demo on t5
just go shadow destro
just play shadow and beat them
mages will get tired of crying for innervates pretty fast
nah
shadow priest was full grief in classic
takes like 4-5 debuff slots
?
fire mage is just better right now
and will be better for p5 progression
sims arent same as real performance
fight lengts are pretty random
you cant just cherry pick the best one
why shouldnt you
more dps is more dps
AQ was literally free
and you were on dead server probably
but mages are support class
:pepebrain:
does vashj trinket actually work for casters?
thought it was physical dps only
firelock is more raid dps
going shadow is grief :pepebrain:
so does vashj trinket work for casters
well he should
its ISB for spriest
imp coe
SE
and moonkin is just always worth it
well it is
whos going to buff motw in ur minmaxed caster stack?
or cast FF?
feral? 6s CD on ff
what happens if it resists
what if it resists again
we are looking at pretty big dps loss
you dont need to
you are wrong
thats why you run 2 mages
one arc fire
one imp blizzard
do mages actually think they will be top dps
you cant have engi goggles and spellfire gloves
because you have enchanting
idk
you run pretty low on mana with lust
has blizz announced t5 release date yet
what phase is haste+sp gems?
can anyone link s2 pvp bracers
and what do they cost
alar bracers?
those will drop a lot
shiffars+sextant :pepebrain:
sextant is bis?
what
they actually blacklisted enslaving demons?
:Pepeclown:
fire mages can grab imp blizzard
quags
sure it is
only 2 months of mag+gruul left
hopefully new world isnt delayed again
or we are doing p1 for rest of our lives
coe or cor is better anyway
what next xpac?
its dead after tbc
you dont need to rank tho?
if you have wbuffs
you can compete with blue weapons
no problem
but if you die and dont have raid weapons, its over
you can
difference is very minimal when you have wbuffs
not even close to 100 dps
id say 50-60
and on gruul keeping up doom is dogshit
because of range issues
it could be 100 dps on gruul
but takes globals
which could be used on immolate/incinerate
druid tanks?
what do you mean overall isnt a metric
only thing people cared about in vanilla was overall
will be same thing in tbc
who cares about wcl
everyone just wants to get out of raid asap
blizz is just killing the game
because they want to compete with new world
what?
there was logs on pservers
if you do that right now, ur retarded anyway
you can only compare ur dps to other people in your raid
99 is literally free in decent guild
in vanilla it was all about who died
and when
cor duty? :Pepeclown:
well you can minmax dps in t5
but in t4 theres literally nothing
i dont think any mob survived more than 15s in naxx
so why use dots
just put the cor up instantly
kara is so bad for warlocks
not even fun
it will be back in t5
kara trash is so good for furies
well it is
warlocks & mages do steady 4k on aoe packs
casting shadowbolts feels so bad
actually doing less dmg than incinerates if ISB isnt up
is r1 cuck warlock actually viable
and has anyone actually done math on spriest problem
yes but what about raid dps
and spriests personal dps
if you have 2 spriests its actually over
2 spriests actually destroy ISB uptime
no if you have 2 shadow priests
its actually over
2nd one just makes raid dps worse
no as in, its over
or go spec into :clowntaclysm:
it doesnt matter really
2nd spriest is the WORST class you can bring
it should never happen
both are better raid dps wise
rogue moonkin and ret are decent dps this phase too
idk
rogues will be strong t6+
wont have aggro problems like furies
2 spriests always eat more ISB than 1
while bringing literally nothing to raid
is there an addon for group switching?
lust for mages means they just oom faster
:pepebrain:
why would they hate fire locks :Pepeclown:
its more raid dps
did hunters already accept the fact that they wont even show up in meters after p1
thats free 20 dmg tho
do you have salvation?
then ur tank sucks
unlucky
blizz actually changed t5 set bonus
it was not base at some point
lust timings are very important too
i have overaggroed pumper feral on prince because i had lust and he didnt
why wouldnt we be able to get q
we can get BT quest right now
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/gy68B6AAoud7c3jHuRpF5T
this is the swp bis i think
jc neck version was a bit more crit but less sp & haste
locks will still outdps mages hard in t5
and dont even need to talk about t6 or swp
@Itsmarco read again
i didnt say mages suck
@Itsmarco yeah if you drink 30s between every pack, arcane pumps
but 99% of guilds wont
most guilds want to do both raids in 1 day
that means no drink breaks
literally only mages need to drink too
well they have to
or risk losing players
no one wants to raid 2 days
not many guilds will be doing t5 split / alt raids tbh
only literally top 5-10 guilds
just drop hunters
problem fixed
well its really not looking good for hunters at all
@Itsmarco the fact that fury will just outdps them
idk whats the point of bringing hunters
especially in t6+
wait why does lock discord have :alliance:
threat was never problem for locks in vanilla
poh was beyond insane
especially with alliances infinite mana
threat literally isnt a problem
you press shatter if you get close
95%
proper support means 3-4 innervates, 3 rotated mana tides and spriest
oh even salad bakers edited logs
every china guild did 100%
removed petri combat uses
after the indicent
and yeah they fixed logs to get nharz #1
but that was way later
well warlock is literally the best class to stack
very well could see speedrun comps literally taking as many locks as its possible
chest wand are bis next phase
other items arent
mobs have low armor values
literally 0 armor
with tbc debuffs
yea
and hit fucks casters harder anyway compared to physical dps
healthstone > dark rune
every time
should be fixed
didnt work in vanilla atleast
it used to work for like a day
and insta fixed
imagine having raid weapon
idk
raid weapon is just better
cba to switch weapons all the time
doesnt max rank shadow bolt do same thing
and it eats charges slower
unless you stop casting when isb is up
id always take emberstorm
ur 2nd global everytime is immolate anyway
shadow always casts immolate on pull
or you risk overaggroing
yes even with MDs
if you shoot 10k shadowbolt 2nd global
you might very well pull
well cast sb if you want
i wont
no?
immolate is always better than corr
no?
its fury/shaman prio
then lock belt
2h users want KT weapon anyway
well probably not
2x belts > 1 weapon probably
because melees get hardfucked by mechanics anyway
but whatever
vash chest is warlock only item
https://i.nuuls.com/zT4es.png this is the bracers im supposed to buy?
its barely upgrade over my old bracers
pvp bracers
md sapper is decently useful
did they fix gcd bug?
havent raided yet
uhh why would you ever have warlock tanking it
why does KT randomly reset aggro sometimes
???
never put mage in ele grp over affli
3% hit on mages is literally wasted
they already get free 3%
point is
affli is always better in that grp than mage
well it is
mages goes oom eventually without spriest
yeah but they go eventually oom
https://i.nuuls.com/l-auS.png
rdy to pump
stormcaller
very unlucky case
crit is anyway better
TLC
i did few raids with my guild and got 7pc t3 and soulseeker
+ motc
any macros that use first cenarion mana pot and then normal?
and it works?
t5 is pretty rough actually
first real raids in classic
just use firestone :pepebrain:
idk having warlock tank leo is just stupid
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/NxX1dRmM2vw7ycBT#fight=25 @hazzbot
warlocks are literally the tankiest class
if they are dying, rest of the raid was dead 5 min ago
i have 9.5k with like 0 stam from gear
no you shouldnt
first thing you do is remove as many melees as you can
well spellfire gloves are bis
immolate isnt always worth if you dont have imp scorch
let bots farm it
does anyone happen to know imp curse of elements spell ID?
or is it same as normal coe
yea
yea its same
shadow is actually dogshit
had to do it on alar
but god its shit
anyone have staff equip macro?
you need to have feral druid use staff
and him tank it
are u sure
mt feral using staff should work
and he didnt get aura from someone else using staff too close?
is it raid wide?
idk my guild killed it fine
does fap work with toybox shit?
like does it make you immune to stun
so if you get toybox just fap?
isnt  quags better
than icon
shadow is actual dogshit atm
needs t5 bis to be competetive
well not really
quags is basically on-use with 45s cd
just feelscraft
go do alar and see that shadow is dogshit
anyone have that isb website
does it work for tbc
i dont think dad guild has time to do 36 attempts
i have been thinking of using major nature protection potion on vael
vashj*
idk
often you have 2 lusts
etc
unless they are chained
the fights that matter tbh
KT vashj
if you can get 2x on uses on vashj
its probably better
like i mean 2x uses on both
any tips for boosting dps on fixate guy
have some rogue applying dagger debuff on him or something
just have your pala pump some heals on locks
and threat should be fine
delay the other wave a bit with imp blizzard
alar is harder imo
kt = vashj > alar = morogrim >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> rest
morogrim is easy as fuck
morogrim is just free
aslong as healers remember to heal MT
like everything else is just easy compared to KT & vashj
and those are hardest fights in tbc
u arent supposed to get conflagged in p3?
we had warrior soak it
was it wrong strat
so dont need soaker at all?
So brew trinket works with icon?
u guys are wrong
mages have infinite mana and arcane will be bis whole game
shadow destro is actual dogshit
avoid at any costs
what do pins say
cba
you give mages 4 set asap
so those mongoloids wont have 7k hp pool
no
4pc hunter is shit
mages first
?? hunters got their almost t5 bis from dungeons
whats the problem
everyone will have full sets in 1 month anyway
its not a problem
u guys are forgetting the fact that mages have infinite mana again
because warlocks get skull
why would ele want vash chest
wtf
they literally need like 1% hit from gear
idk
guilds really shouldnt piss off warlocks
or they will have problems in future
belf lock is based
you could argue belf is actually better
because you dont get heal debuff
fight club died the day they banned me
pretty sure kebab is just better spec
idk about that moonkin
feels pretty bad seeing them doing half of my dps
would rather have more warlocks
nah
hunters are worst
fuck them
idk how locks even lose
i dont even have raid weapon and topping meters
you could do swp with current gear
your rl should be more concerned with raid dps
ur not killing vashj or KT if you dont have enough dps
what about stam
everyone will have belt of blasting in a month anyway
your guild just needs one pattern to drop
ur getting atleast 4 vortex per week
more likely around 8 per week
thats 4 belts
quags makes you tap faster too
i dont even have threat problems seeding
just get good paladin
theres always 1% miss chance
vashj kt
double on-use imo
no vestments = dogshit loot
wait
do you need to actually kill flying nether rays on vashj?
thornlings are immune?
so 🤔
raid dropping thornlings is 100% kill
has anyone used thornling tactic yet
and they dont die?
if they die its not that good
well its infinitely better if they dont die
dark rune is a trap
would much rather have healthstone
dying is pretty big dps loss
and on fights that matter means you wipe the raid
nah
flame cap is parse mechanic
dark rune is just pure cope
i wonder if you can banish druids in tree form on vashj
has anyone tried
so you cant banish tree form druids?
yes but banish isnt real CC
how do you wipe on karathess
was easiest boss in whole place
pretty sure its supposed to wipe threat?
no
give them to mages
sure they do
if it gets them 2 pc or 4pc
affli still beats pretty much any other spec
so it doesnt matter rly
any other class*
1 tap isnt
2 taps + multi is death in p1
you do as fire
we do the kite strat
adds a lot of time to p1
we got it to 65.5% without anything special
used the pillar
banish didnt work on MC'd trees btw
:pepebrain:
pipe+quags
whats the name of KT dagger debuff
tab immolating on alar
pretty sure dots dont proc shadowflame
? dont kill add when ur stacked
how is that hard
dont dot them
you shouldnt
its wasted dps
WHY
you dont kill them
killing them just makes fight harder
they deal like 0 dmg
shadow is a meme
female nelf?
could have played druid too i guess
for me its Grunt Hannusumm
idk
its not fun anymore
now that they are losing to everyone
i almost ALMOST feel bad for them
idk how they even wiped that many times
they had pretty much perfect comp
vashj and KT are the hardest bosses in tbc
everything after this will be easy
every dps check will be just easy
warlocks will be top 1 rest of the tbc
yea
and aoe
yep even ST
warlocks will have 500 haste in swp
no?
you go 5/5 SE as affli
ban this guy
you go 5/5 SE because what else you would take
if ur affli
you take 5/5 SE
simple as that
ToC + haste OH has to be better
than zhardoom
idk guys
ToC is just better
no?
you much rather use mana pot
multi doesnt hit up to 9k
more like 7-8k
multishot isnt even a problem
problem is poison farts
you die to farts if you dont get healed
for 18s
:peepohigh:
this should be :pipe:
so in t6 quags+motc is bis until you get skull?
i did doom on pull
it popped perfectly during transition
and i died
wait we are talking loe?
leo?
yea
idk easier to just not use doom on hydross
its whatever
no?
you have imp coe as aff ruin
just dont use shadow dmg wand if you want to wand
its simple
theres no way ur 1m ahead non curse lock
if ur cursing
@Shukumei ur locks suck tbh
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/NxX1dRmM2vw7ycBT#boss=-3&difficulty=0
this was my last weeks SSC
i wasnt cursing, other locks were
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/gzfh4DaqCkKyGPZR#boss=-3&difficulty=0
this is our TK
i was cursing and suwacko wasnt
ur never beating noncurse locks if ur cursing
fang to paladin isnt good
unless they dont have magus blade
no you really cant
other locks have to be worse
? on trash ur supposed to be casting curse a lot
so you are cucking ur raid
by not casting the lowest mana cost highest dmg spell?
so ur griefing the raid
that explains why ur #1
paladins take the mace
you actually cant raid without prot palas
you can always use the ToC + oh hit
and if you have ToC
its easier to yoink SWP dagger+oh
do people kill eggs in p5?
bros speedkills matter
we used pala
but idk
staff buff has nothing to do with threat resets right?
everyone will have belts in 2-3 weeks
doesnt matter rly
yes thats a problem
i just drink mana pots
its cheaper
drinking mana pot asap saves you taps
you can drink it after 4-5 casts
on vashj you can drink destro pots p2
but its wasted dps so idk
in p3 you want mana pot rdy
every tap in p3 increases ur chances of dying
you want to avoid tapping at any costs
p2 destro pot is literally wasted
you dont gain anything with it
p2 dps literally doesnt matter
Its permanent trinket right
Motc is 4th best trinket
what? mages have infinite mana
they dont even need innervates
@Pelican waking up and knowing im not a shadow lock
you dont need green hit gems if you have vestments
uhh
if you cow just uninstall
@themick you dont need sim, just feelscraft
:peepohigh:
not needed if you have good pala
no?
its wasted
just get good pala
idk
get good prot pala
idk i just do like 1-2 coe
and spam seed
not really
its still 100 sp for moonkin and ele
better than useless tranq
its not 0 dps?
tranq is 0 dps
idk
they hold just fine
uhh?
why wouldnt you sapper as pala
this is why some guilds have problems with threat
hunters can help with MD sapper too
oblivion set makes big difference if ur not aoe capped
?
not even close
nothing beats 4pc oblivion if ur not aoe capped
male draenei?
:peepohigh:
why do you even care about demon form
it just dies at that point
losing wbuffs as warlock
:peepohigh:
doesnt even matter
:peepohigh:
ur competing with healers on meters
sure you did
what
not a single warlock in vanilla was allowed to use corruption AND cod
fury would be even better if debuff cap was removed
vashj not randomly shooting people makes it easy
and every week people have more hp
are u guys telling people to grab 1/5 SE again?
!pipe
ZA healer neck is bis until swp i think
it should go to whoever doesnt have raid weapon yet
after that doesnt matter really
:peepohigh:
stormcaller users need their own parse section tbh
idk
atiesh loses a lot of value
in normal lock grp
moonkin ele
not really?
not really no
you drop moonkin in warlock speedrun comp
but in normal raid its worth it
barely
its same reason why moonkin is the green sp amulet slave
and not a warlock
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1010/#dataset=99
lets see
is moonkin/ele sp as valuable as warlock sp?
And you mainly bring moonkin for 3% hit and 100% uptime on FF
warlock grp is just the best place to put him
most guilds run moonkin
unless going very heavy caster stack
you need boots of blasting before switching to engi
nah
they are milking tbc as long as possible
wotlk is instant death to classic
if you think people will be running naxx 25 for 6 months
ur delusional
no
it was 3½ months too long
t5 should have been out day 1
black temple should be opening right about now
where?
burgerland?
britain?
oh no no non
zerohedge called this
affliction is very close to destro atm
and brings ISB
its almost always worth it
and affli has better seed
its not raid dps loss
brings ISB for spriest
and is a warlock
what math
not really no
fire does more raid dps
ok
thing is usually afflis arent in caster grp
and usually affli players arent good
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/gzfh4DaqCkKyGPZR#fight=25
this was our last weeks voidreaver
in that fight affli was 100% worth it
bringing isb to spriest and malediction
everyone knows fire is more raid dps
dont get cucked by your mages
sapph enchant > other stuff
actually if you care about parse you should be worrying about raid dps
faster the boss dies better parse ur going to get
are they using 4pc t4?
probably right
top parse afflis not using 4pc t4?
i dont believe that
i just wish i was male orc
:peepohigh:
lost at character creation screen
no
belf racial is close
no heal debuff
melees should never be on striders
unless ur running like +8 melees
nope
we tried not banishing first
half the raid died
uhh why isnt firelock doing cor in that comp
let 2nd affli do doom
https://i.nuuls.com/zD77D.png
this is actually better comp
theres no spots
already running 4 healers
hunter is the puller
and helps with threat a lot
arms is for demo/tclap/ extra threat/ OT
sure
lets invite 36 druids,12 resto shamans and 3 spriests to support our 12 mages
holy is 100% required in 4 healer comp with 12 locks
you still need 2 blessings
oh you want to 3 heal it?
probably not worth it
dragonling works?
its same bug as chicken had almost whole vanilla probably
it didnt work in vanilla
melees never finish anything
u gotta kill the mob as warlock or it doesnt die
i just usually conflag it
because you actually cant trust melees/hunters to finish mobs
they can wand aslong as its not shadow dmg wand
threat really isnt a problem
any idea why mages think TLC is their bis atm?
no dont switch sacs if you need to seed a bit during boss
morogrim is aoe capped
TK weapon dmg is irrelevant
it wasnt in vanilla tho
because blizz wanted to cuck horde warriors
yea it worked like 2 days
and insta fixed
in p1
you want murlocs in range of morogrim tbh
so you can seed morogrim
pretty sure pservers had different mana regen formula for mages
and fights were longer
and anyway pure fire mage was better even in classic p1
raid dps wise
play fury in tbc
wotlk*
or dont play at all
@Slacker imagine wanting to play class thats not carrying the raid
@JohnT how did the meta change
locks and mages still king
if fury beats locks, locks are bad
2 spriests
:peepohigh:
you go fire
if you have 2 spriests
even if you dont have imp scorch
yep doing alar was so stupid
first time i was casting sb in tbc
ur not getting 99s with resto shaman
early on its easy to get 99s
in few weeks ur not getting even close without ele shaman
KT is pretty much freeloot now
imagine wanting to lip instead of mana potting
no arena literally doesnt matter at all
like 0.1% of population even plays it
yea lets balance game around mode which like 0.1% of population plays
:peepohigh:
no
didnt know everyone here was in a speedrun guild
when ur speedrunning you dont have time to switch sacs
but you arent running arcane mage either
melee can dps just fine
ehh weapon dmg is pretty much wasted
just use paladin tank
its 2021
he needs fire res set for BT anyway
make him get one now
its not even parse thing,. paladin tank is safer
5 healers is actually easier
ur aoe capped on morogrim
so oblivion is useless
dispelled?
protip
dont do ssc with 1 paladin
@InsaneKane no
you tank her where she spawns
:peepohigh:
https://i.nuuls.com/RE4b7.png
*coughs blood*
vashj with 1 paladin
you can shift as tank
thats how every feral tank drank potions in vanilla
they shifted between boss attacks
Biggest problem is t4 shadow gear is dogshit
:peepohigh:
bosses dont drop warlock tier
:peepohigh:
never going to get t5 legs at this rate
you should always boil the water
imagine having raid weapon
:peepohigh:
you already have too much hit in t5 gear
does he press consecration?
i heard you can tank them if pala has block set
yep mages have infinite mana in good guilds
0 drink breaks
0 fillers
dont even need innervates
mages just have infinite mana
blizzard is useless on morogrim
you dont need imp blizz at all
pally just heals locks
no threat problems
bro mages just need full t5 bis and 3 innervates to beat locks
:peepohigh:
hunter trap?
mages have infinite mana
dont even need innervates
speedruns wont even have arcane mages
yes ending the fight at 0 mana so you can drink 1 min
that sounds smart
oh no no no nonwarlock bros
not my problem.
you dont swap any trinket as warlock
literally have 0 hp items and still have highest hp amount of any casters
thats shoot
its supposed to oneshot
just use pvp bracers
25 stam, 13 resilience
actually big
people dont use elvui ?
easiest way to track stuff
@Gale i have important stuff whitelisted and aura bar showing whitelist + personal
very easy to edit what you want to see
can you enslave it?
:pepebrain:
parsing meta?
uhh
how does that make sense
hunter pets count for parse
is it cheesing
or viable tactic
well it is legit tactic for sure
thats what everyone used for speedkills
so? half of hunters dps is pet
dont see people complaining about them
so ban every log with ankh used?
what about recklessness
should recklessness be banned
infernal is super nerfed in this patch
its lvl 50 iirc
no fun allowed
was nerfed in original tbc because of swp
are they fire
shadow lock & affli is pretty close tbh
Mage bros, its over
We are forced to play fire in next tier
How do we get seed bug fixed now
Dildo is bis in swp
Sunflare is the dildo
Why wouldnt you enchant HKM cloak, its bis until t6
Mages get their scaling from free  t5, how many locks have a single loot yet
Mages already got all their scaling from this tier
Its over
Top mages already have 2/4pc t5, how many locks have t5 bis
New world is doa
is there any way to check how many shadowbolts were affected by isb
blizz already fucked up
t4+t5+hyjal should have been out day 1
it was
no one just could clear t5
it wasnt unkillable
nothing is unkillable
people were doing like 500 dps in original tbc
ofc it had
dps has to do with everything
@Xelrog soulstone healers?
combat rezz them?
they had wbuffs+ALL consumables
yeah
they had wbuffs,EVERYSINGLE CONSUMABLE INGAME
just because people sucked 15 years ago doesnt mean it was unkillable
you could SS from outside the raid
people were just so bad in 2007
they literally played with 800x600 screens
oh like it was on original tbc?
pipe+eye or icon+eye?
:peepohigh:
no skull is top
motc below
what about shifting naaru sliver
its not politics
its math
arc/fire loses literally nothing
vs locks going shadow
but tbh really should have 4th lock
affli
solves all the problems
like mage sims now?
you cant trust them
ruin
uhh you put affli in the 2nd caster grp
not in tank group
yea
and affli
gain 100sp? benefit from spriest mana
i think that counts as destro?
not affli
if MT keeps dying imp wont help
you have some bigger problems
the fact that arc/fire loses like 100 dps
while needing less mana support
do mage sims even cast any fillers?
do they assume IV is always up for the fight?
i dont do math
i feelscraft
i know that you cant trust mage sim lmao
they were shilling arcane in p1
so how exactly does arcane/frost beat arcane/fire without IV
(icy veins)
so we take 2½min break between every pack right?
so arcane mage has IV every fight
im talking about total dps here
how?
sure thing
are we assuming mages have infinite mana again?
okay so, mage has 2x IV and infinite mana every fight
oh so mana on trash doesnt matter?
and you dont even bring a 2nd mage
if hes not bringing imp scorch
oh so arcane mage has infinite mana for vashj?
to just AB
so if we bring 2 mages
bring 6 druids so both of them can just perma cast AB
you mean they kill adds asap in add phase right?
and not afk
no?
you want to kill adds asap
so lurker comes up faster
lmao
idk comes up instantly after last one dies for us
maybe its just lucky timing
in what fights are they wrecking locks?
morogrim?
what else
oh if you can feed pure dps class 5-6 support classes it can pump?
how many of those mages have multiple pieces of t5 loot?
how many locks have a single piece?
how many of those mages are doing coe/cor
max arcane being 150 dps ahead lock
actual dead spec
full t5 bis mage beating t4 gear locks by 150 dps?
with multiple innervates
and haste bug
well we both know that mage has 4pc t5 and multiple innervates
we can go check the top locks gear too
probably not wearing t5 bis
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1010#metric=dps&partition=2&class=DPS&boss=0&dpstype=wdps
actually
only on morogrim makes are really beating locks?
and thats because of infinite mana
oh so he has full t5 bis
and what gear does the lock have?
ofc he did
i already said he has full t5 bis and atleast 3 innervates
but what gear does the lock have
what if you bring 2 mages
have mages thought about that yet
@Est do you also bring 2 spriests and 12 druids?
@Healspls okay so hes t4 geared like i said
?
and t5 bis mage with atleast 3 innervates is only ahead by 150 dps?
okay so why bring 2 mages
instead of feeding one with all innervates
that comp is scuffed
https://i.nuuls.com/zD77D.png
this is the comp
could replace fire mage with another lock
but idk
shadow could be misery weaver/disc
yea arcane is dead spec p3 now
fire is just better
mages already want sp drums instead of haste
:peepohigh:
actual mental illness
what about IV+lust
IV+lust+drums(very possible situation)
so when do you use AP ?
or they could be just casting fireballs
with normal good gear
skull was always lock only item
yea mages are going to take warlocks gear
:peepohigh:
locks doing 2x of their dmg
well at that point ur stacking lusts to locks
while they have 500 haste
going to be big numbers
you are shadow in swp
can probably switch even in t6
shadow still more raid dps
just dont bring mage
buy int scrolls
what about curse issue?
do we stop casting curses on those bosses
5 casts doing dps vs 1 cast doing 0 dmg
if we are speedrunning, raid is full of shadow locks
maybe one mage
big maybe
@Healspls so are you saving IV for aoe phase
or how does frost mage do better aoe
yes 18 geared arcane mages,6 spriests and 54 druids
that sounds pretty good comp
idk dude
rank 1 scorch is pretty efficient
so we assume infinite mana?
p2 dps is irrelevant
expect in the very end
they could pool the mana, do 5 scorches on boss
and then pump
oh so mage has infinite mana for that 2 min
casting 1s ABs
they could be chilling, casting r1 scorches
personal dps?
or raid dps
kael'thas or kel'thuzad?
theres no way u can survive 33 mins on kel'thuzad
why are these locks shadow
when they have fire mage
waiting brezz CD maybe?
yep
removes you from threat table
soul leech is extra threat right
:peepohigh:
you make the non orc warlock capernian tank ofc
:pepebrain:
theres always one
show them the pic
and say ur going fire
i dont think i can get used to 2.5 cast time
pumping incinerates with lust is too fun
ur pretty much never dropping immo with scorch
sure its only 5% when 2x priests insta snipe isb
:peepohigh:
uhh
pretty sure its higher
has to depend pretty heavily on affli crit rating
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/gzfh4DaqCkKyGPZR#fight=25&type=auras&spells=debuffs&hostility=1&ability=17800
60% isb with 1 affli 1 spriest
well check the log
the one i linked
@JordanF yea casting incinerates
yea but u guys were saying 20-40 isb uptime from 1 affli
and that sounds pretty low
well he had 33% crit on isb
not that high
isnt isb 4 stacks
not 5
tbh guys, its time to drop spriests
ids/misery weaver slave is the way to go
bro just bring 2 enhas to swp
:peepohigh:
its literal melee class
tbh you should be running 2 ele shamans and like 4-6 locks even in casual comps
its called the shaman problem, you dont want too many healers but you want many shamans
so gotta bring few dps shamans
will be in t6 too
if its long phase
just go shadow lock in t6 tbh
dab on everyone
imagine having frost mage in raid
:peepohigh:
affli bringing isb is pretty big if you have spriest+fire destros
and affli pumps with seed
healer neck is a bit better i think
ur playing in hunter stacking guild
how many loots does illidan drop
2?
like how many drops per reset
i heard fem UDs can do it
but not sure
brown is the chad role
hard carrying in vanilla and then hard carrying on warlock
you want more melees for p3?
KT ?
yeah p3 has so many melee friendly fights
:peepohigh:
striders arent a problem
p2 is easy if everyone is pressing buttons
that comp is never going to clear
those locks are phase 3 bis first reset
when the content is hardest?
restokin
:peepohigh:
why are you even bringing mage in that comp
pretty sure we just run behind them and aoe pack down
OH NO NO NO NO NO NO
why are you playing demo
moro just favors mage with innervate
lock runs oom and has to tap
mage just pumps
not counting add dps would be stupid
it means ur curse slave always
very unlucky
its about 900 sp value when under aoe cap
idk only "hard" packs are pre leo imo
you can pull 2x murloc packs
i would go for socket bonus tbh
orange+blue sp
@Itsmarco imagine buying belt
actual 100g item next week
remember when someone killed onyxia 50 times without seeing DB
and nefarian 30 times without seeing crul
its 100g item next week
who would pay for it
wowhead says 44% drop rate
its not right probably?
maybe skull is common
🙏
!pipe
what was blizz thinking when they made skull
they knew it would destroy guilds
If you want skull in dkp guild, you cant bid on any item before it
DKP just doesnt work, literally any other loot system is better
If you want 700 dps moonkin getting skull and imploding the guild, its perfect system
So its not dkp? Its lc then
Dkp with loot prio is LC
More like 1 mil
Inflation is crazy
It was just them washing bought gold
well its either that or dpsing fixate guy
id say its even
do you even need SR gear
hopefully they dont do PTR
decent
:peepohigh:
"decent"
what the fuck am i reading
actual bottom tier dps
that means ur guild is dogshit
just get glaives
:peepohigh:
and at that point warlocks have t6 gear too
and casters get haste
is this rogue in 2x bm+feral+enha grp?
every class performs way better in t6
especially warlocks
id say warlocks get most compared to other classes
from t6 gear
excluding glaives(which you might never see)
we are getting literally nothing from t5
vestments barely better than spellfire
by many you mean alar?
other classes get pretty massive upgrades
bs weapons, mage t5
i have 9.5k hp with full spellfire
and spellstrike legs
thats more than every other caster & hunters
not really no?
warlocks are last to die to multishot
other classes die to that too
spellstrike+spellfire
why would you ever take ISB
just let other warlocks apply ISB on alar
:pepebrain:
https://i.nuuls.com/5ga7t.png
decent void reaver
still using stormcaller
idk everyone just got lusts
should have double lusted warlocks tbh
but probably would have pulled aggro
already tanked a hit had to soulshatter
idk nothing special
just pumper tanks
you actually dont want pvp weapon
too much hit once you get few t5 pieces
not even that helps
ur using HKM cloak anyway
pretty sure mana was removed in wotlk
its pretty much removed in tbc already
for most classes
you dont want to play warlock
just play fury
warlock is still dogshit
fury is still best
casters are even worse with no wbuffs
because they run oom when boss is at 70%
u spend most of the fight tapping
fury just pumps even with no wbuffs
rogue is worse fury
with way worse cleave
no
furies are day 1
until end of the game
did they actually do 700 dps
feels so low
@Falcrist actually removing wbuffs fixes all threat problems even on horde
gear is way more important with no wbuffs tbh
ehhh
fury prot is better even with no wbuffs
and brings sunder
well hunters are 3rd
nothing else changes really
meme specs are even worse
because you dont have wbuffs carrying the raid
hunters fall off a cliff p2
even without wbuffs
that class has actual 0 scaling
no not really?
no not really
have you even played pservers
none but there wasnt as much wbuff stacking
a lot of wipes
northdale
yeah less wbuff stacking on pservers
hunters did good dmg p1
healers heal
punishing people with loot doesnt make sense
main thing was salv, but threat isnt a issue anyway with no wbuffs
so horde is just ahead
furies were still hitting boss from behind, with 60% crit and 3k AP
vs tank hitting from front
on alliance?
lmao
no you pop MRP
:pepebrain:
and pray u dont show up on boss target
nah
vashj is way harder
wait
is warlock actually good in vanilla with unlimited debuffs
dont seed too early, you dont want to tank all the adds
but dont seed too late
judgement?
idk some pala
why do you care
do warlocks even get mana from it
i thought it was just hunter thing
She*
Look at her pfp
VR doesnt even oneshot you
i tanked one hit
another lock tanked a hit too i think
hunter? ban this guy
muru will be oneshotted by everyone
why wouldnt you give zhardoom to locks
literally the only scaling class in whole game
well you should in t6
giving zhardoom to moonkin
when its doing 1k dps is waste
instead of giving it to warlock so he can do 3k
many classes get "decent" in t6
warlock just gets insane
what?
if lock does 2x the dmg of other classes
giving zhardoom to him is always the best choice
literally only warlock scales
yea giving zhardoom to lock over moonkin is hot take
:peepohigh:
who said that?
show me moonkin doing 1.5k dps right now
on total
comparing vanilla and tbc warlock doesnt make sense
t6 is just insane for locks
and best scaling class from haste
is it
people are saying here you should give zhardoom to moonkin over lock
its just very hard to give 1k dps class loot over 2.5k dps class
same as vanilla
you had to give loot to furies instead of hunters
not really
you just bring another warlock
thats dogshit logic
did u guys give hunters first motc?
well t5 content is actually hard compared to t4 and vanilla
sac voidwalker
it helps a bit
well a lot actually
idk i dont have any problems with dailies
just need few bandages for demon q
are you fire?
well try immolate+incinerate instead of shadow
feels pretty smooth imo
well not really, fire and shadow talents are literally the same
aslong ur not using shadoweave stuff it should be fine
everything dies before they even hit you
not anymore
ur doing dailies if anything
warlocks
its warlock class trinket
you use eye
pipe+eye
why would you do this
instead of just killing the boss
pretty sure its easier to just kill the boss
if china is using it
they wont fix it
cant lose the pay pigs
immo conflag immo incinerate rotation :pepebrain:
thing is, arc/fire doesnt lose 250 dps
and most warlocks right now are rolling in t4 gear
which is dogshit for shadow
vestments will drop tomorrow 🙏
already seen one drop
the strat is actually harder to do than just normally killing it
like whats the problem?
do the pillar trick
kill the boss
what do you mean its a cheese
it is?
or it would have been fixed in original tbc
@jpaint it literally doesnt make the fight harder at all
that has never happened to us
i saw rag p2 week 1
not really
maybe if you run dog comp
but you should be very fury/rogue heavy in classic anyway
yep, that makes casters even worse
because they have mana problems
u need fury/rogue stack to clear
they will do wrath, but they shouldnt
its going to flop hard
dude wotlk was easy in 2008
can you imagine it now
naxx 25 for 5 months?
game is going to be beyond dead
yeah ur 500 dps really helped the raid
@McGoo yes? thats a gquit situation
because arcane mage benefits more from spriest
it means ur guild is just clueless
even then, arcane mage is the last class you bring to warlock grp
just go 12 warlock comp
thats scuffed
i made way better comp
https://i.nuuls.com/zD77D.png
you cant fit anymore in
12 is max amount
2nd blessing
you want 4 healers
you want 2 blessings
cant 3 heal before haste probably
3 healing doesnt sound viable atm
even with 12 warlocks
you could have spriest be misery/ids
but probably not worth it
and you can only get 2/3 misery
if IDS/misery spec
so probably not worth it
people are already running 4 healers
restokin what the fuck
why would you ever bring that
dogshit healer
with imp ff
well not really
holy priest becomes THE best healer
and then shamans
you can and someone will
healing 12 locks is easy
thats the whole point of why locks are best
healing 12 hunters+ their pets is a lot harder
well with 4 healers u gotta innervate the priest
have a lot of locks
very few melees
soul leech is extra threat right
idk probably on voidreaver it hard griefs you
conflag isnt shit
its the best finisher
no its not
searing pain does 0 dmg
and if ur casting conflag, ur not going to get extra ticks from immo
because mob is at 1-5% hp
i have seen locks in "top guilds" use seed on 3 mobs
sure thing buddy
every player in top guilds plays perfectly ofc
yea shadowburn and eat ISB dude
:Pepeclown:
then later on when ur turreting, just tap
that sounds real smart
playing perfectly :Pepeclown:
reapplying immolate when it drops is perfect
alar has free taps
cataclysm is 0 value
just play fire
idk why we are theorycrafting inferior specs
solarian,VR,morogrim,leo(maybe),KT,vashj
lurker below maybe with lust
hydross you have some few free taps on switch
nah on KT you hard turret
p4 p5
on vashj too
idk im just stuck at 0 mana on vashj always
maybe its because im fire but idk
its 100% mana pot fight p3
btw are thornlings immune to nature dmg?
or do you need to split them
so 25x thornlings should make fight free loot?
where do you farm them?
big room?
how many kara speedruns were running fire mages
ofc
idk if you dont have either
you should be fel dom switching for prince for sure
everysingle one?
i just checked top 3
all had spriest
kara was pretty scuffed anyway
im pretty sure best comp was just stacking furies
bigger question is do you even bring mages
mages to a speedrun
you most likely want to innervate healers
its like 5s break between pulls
you dont have that many ticks to drink
and how many innervates do you even bring
2-3
1-2 being feral innervates
that mage could be another lock
who has more hp and is easier to heal
? just say something
or switch grp urself
whats the problem
healer took sextant?
uhhh why would you ever give sextant to pala
you tell him its not bis
problem solved
should be lock prio
its bis in a lot of fights
on specific fight lengths is for sure better than pipe or icon
on trash its big
fight length?
sextant+quags pretty sick for fire
get vashj trinket and dont have to switch like at all
wait why would crit lose more value
because of the bug?
isnt it always same number at aoe cap
btw how do we get the bug fixed
ahh i understand
but dont you have more chances to crit too?
if you use that logic, haste should lose value too more mobs you have
yes but you crit more mobs
with more crit
how extreme are we talking
100?
did we ever figure out optimal range for max dps?
:pepebrain:
are you sure it works like that
you are already casting seed when last one is flying
i dont think TLC problem can be fixed
so ban people from aoeing on moro
and ban people from doing dps on p2 vashj
or you dont do that
stop caring about parses
just try to be top dps in ur raid
thats all you can do
or dont do that
parses literally dont matter
you cant trust mages
well if ur running 3 mages one should be pure fire or arc fire
(or skill)
you could argue same thing about every boss
can hunters even dps VR?
So on morogrim MCing murloc for armor debuff works?
9% hit cap?
:peepohigh:
5% for 72s
16% for 73
could check old videos
so wont need oblivion
well in p3 you want to prio haste
but haste > crit >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> sp
100% crit with 0 crit/hit items
well top guilds didnt have spriest or weaver like ever
and sometimes didnt even have cos
yea blizz is going to add wbuffs for sure
:peepohigh:
i dont see point in fresh with wbuffs
yep until you die
but that was mainly horde problem
pipe+quag's sims best
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/qQkHw2GPfKT6gWLX#boss=-3&difficulty=0&source=15
doesnt show my trash set
whats up with these red gems and prince cloak
switch to oranges + HKM
vestments should be blue gem
okay ill do better set
give me 5 min
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/g4JEF8WPsKymH1yaAP6sGf
loses few sp gains equal amounts of crit
i like stam
you should like it too
and most people arent playing on dead servers where you can get wbosses
or even care about them
someone said here sextant was broken
proccing on non crits
even on curse casts
shadow
:peepohigh:
people actually want to wear 0 stam items
:peepohigh:
its useful always
nice on VR especially
sextant/eye
why would you be using 2 on-use
sextant is way better on fire anyway
who plays shadow
:peepohigh:
griefing the raid
ofc they play fire
its more raid dps
so its more raid dps?
female human bis
or belf
thats the best content
:pepebrain:
well using 8 hit gem is fine aslong you have 0 red 9sp gems
for me its 8 hit
neither does wearing more crit
if we are going for dps ceiling, you go only for sp
but it doesnt cast in DI?
whats up with morogrim
literally impossible to get decent parse on fast kill
mages have infinite mana on morogrim
you need to tap
innervates
if ur not already saving for skull in dkp guild
ur never going to make it
squish doesnt matter
unless ur fully resetting it
its like tear
but way better
well you can give it to every lock if ur lucky
depends on drop rate
and on luck ofc
sounds like its DKP but actually its LC
guilds imploding over skull will be great content
no one cares about ashes tbh
uhh
t5 doesnt have that many good items
maybe vestments and not even that is so big
wtf is squid game
is this somekind of chinese psy op
idk seen too many people mention it
has to be a psyop
are u guys paid shills?
do americans really watch stuff with dubs?
double bolt?
nightfall?
:peepohigh:
oh
how do you pull aggro as affliction
do you use warrior tank?
well that explains it
you dont run warrior MT
(you shouldnt)
in general
threat is just dog compared to feral
idk
afflilock pulling aggro is pretty unusual
but if its warrior tank, sure its possible
wait
so why did morogrim kill him then
if not overaggro
11k threat at 30s is pretty yikes
morogrim has knockback?
in really good guilds you start cutting healers
for more dps
lotro was great
thats because t4 shadow gear is dog
does tbc have any patchwerk bosses
https://i.nuuls.com/q4H_x.png
any 40sp chads in the chat
need all the speed boosts for my 60% mount
why would you be
40sp is bis
it is tbh
if you play SB only build
sure go soulfrost
well its barely
and then you cant play fire
10g primal airs
printing money
shadow 13g
you play fury or DK in wotlk
not warlock
fury is bis whole expansion
well really
belts gonna crash hard
why wouldnt you sell them atm
well blasting belt isnt even upgrade for fire locks
you lose set bonus if you dont have vestments
1-2 dps doesnt matter
belt of blasting is 0 stam
and?
i still have 10k hp
with spellfire and spellstrike legs
thats giga frief
grief
arcane/fire is even bigger upgrade
they want 4pc t5 atleast
every spec
not sure whats the best offpiece
but vestments is warlock item
your class is finally a winner
you should be happy
well you shouldnt be playing fire anyway
arc/fire is better
300 dps loss is like 1/5 of a player
in some guilds even 1/4
ofc it matters
if ur struggling on striders , vashj is never going to die
net WA?
can you share
if ur low on warlocks/hunters vashj is very very hard
if you have too many melees vashj is very very very very hard
switch one mage to fire
switch locks to fire
helps a lot on striders
you have 2 locks wearing spellstrike helm, thats a giga grief
sunfire chest is bis
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/hDK5YTszAcjZDQpYBQZUDt
swp bis
35% haste from gear
will be fun
next tier is kinda weird
going to have fire mage
but shadow might be more raid dps
uhh pretty sure you should
atleast later on
sure they will
:peepohigh:
fire mages will be best mage spec in t6
@Falcrist whats the haste cap for warlock?
we had discussion about this earlier, and didnt get clear answer
yea but for incinerate/shadow bolt
well ur getting around 35% haste from gear in swp bis
add drums + on-use trinkets+lust and you might get to 70-80%
lust and PI stacking sounds giga broken
wait
how does that pull work
yea but why arent they charging raid?
wait
so if you just stack everything on that wall
you can pump freely?
10 haste or 5 haste+6sp
maybe, probably
hard to say
i wouldnt trust haste sims
its going to depend on specific break point probably
???
your guild isnt moving moonkin and ele to mage group
nice guild you have
maybe they finally had it and are here to make us play shadow
what was the link to threat website
https://i.nuuls.com/gPgme.png
this was our last week
me and other lock both tanked onehit from VR
you can have warrior dualwield tank too
but idk if its better for threat
you put moonkin in the warlock + ele grp
or dont have one at all
if you have atieshes
4x lock+ele is better probably
atiesh loses so much value on ele/moonkin
well in speedclears you dont have moonkin
you are basically trading warlocks spell power for moonkin/ele spell power
which does more dmg?
i had to craft around +10k pots to get all flask recipes
but crafting flasks isnt even worth it
uhhh
3 mages is too many
i think we have 4 fangs from 2 raids
very lucky
thats like giving mageblade to hpalas
by telling him its warlock prio?
isnt boomies and eles t5 chest pretty good
good enough
afflilock is almost always raid dps upgrade
especially if ur running fire locks
ofc it can happen
all healers graved
etc
SE is never useless
it saves healer mana
well not really
cata does nothing for seed
not really
we are maybe talking 2-5 taps per raid
threat meter is useless, if you see yourself as boss target press soulshatter
:pepebrain:
in t6 its stupid to use lusts on anything but warlocks
lust affects 4 people
fury warrior is 1 person
more like 35-36%
not really
maybe on taps
but never for sb/incinerate
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/k4Sb5qC5c66V7diVQQus9x
well if you want to minmax raid dps, you chainlust warlocks @Aloysius
simple as that
soft cap?
:Pepeclown:
can we stop
@Arli hunters are waiting for t6? nice joke
pets get 0 benefit from ARP
hunters actual dead class in t6
and we benefit from haste
hunters get nothing from arp
furys and rogues will shit on hunters
and warlocks will shit on everyone
eye
parsing even 99 on morogrim is impossible
if you arent the only aoe class
how long fight?
maybe if you killed 3 waves
3:53
thats 3 waves
dont do haste
do CSD
@Moogul its good because set bonus is worth 900 sp
but only when below aoe cap
what?
why would quag+sextant be meh
if it procs early
so? its still single target dps
which is more important imo
why
destro is almost same raid dps
especially if ur running shadow locks
searing pain is better manawise
it is good
its like -600 threat on crits
because salv and shit reduces the 1k
what else would you sac?
and ur casting shadowbolts in that fight
bro
ur casting shadow bolts most of the fight
how many warlocks/mages do you have?
murlocs should be dying instantly with 3 mages+locks
are mages arcane?
if ur running good comp
murlocs die very fast
but he has 3 mages & warlocks
murlocs should die fast
lusting phys dps is pretty good too
boss has almost 0 armor
with MC trick
well they probably should be
if they have 3 mages&warlocks
adds shouldnt be a problem
well lets see the logs
so we can solve the issue
you dont even need to kite at all
but paladin needs correct gear for face tanking
tell him to press seed
simple as that
fire mage with no threat talent might pull with AE
@Pilpouf/Altan you have arms warrior?
@Pilpouf/Altan so he should be doing imp demo
not a fucking warlock
i only used it once whole tbc so far, nightbane with pala tank and no druids/warriors
it still works
and you only run 1 affli
AND YOU NEVER USE COW
so have 2nd affli ( if you actually have 2 afflis) do cor or imp doom
both better than cow
warriors do demo shout
you tell him no, warriors do demo shout
refuse to go destro
:peepohigh:
usually the problem is people dont want to be affli
implying gdkps will consistently clear BT
they are struggling mega hard with t5 already
vashj is not harder than illidan
and BT is way longer
way way longer
even seeing one glaive drop during whole tbc is lucky
seeing 2 is unlikely
and deathbringer was 8%
i did 52 onyxias without seeing one
yep 8/10
sure theyll clear BT :peepohigh:
after its nerfed
im sure gdkps will clear vashj&kt once they have been nerfed too
gdkps were clearing naxx with wbuffs
sure it was
with wbuffs
and what server was that
just because you stack 20 warriors and full wbuffs
doesnt mean gdkp players were good
and i said consistently
BT is a long raid
a lot of trash
not really no
and in naxx you had wbuffs
yep
how many gdkps easily cleared t5 week 1
more than i would imagine
id bet its under 10
and chinese dont count
how many hours / days do they raid
how many buyers do they have
why would they sell glaives?
what the fuck are they going to do with gold
literally useless
game is actual dead after tbc
and u need 0 gold for tbc
its basically poopsocker guilds selling boosts
not gdkps
well really
that group isnt going to kill morogrim
or vashj
thats like 9 melees
actually never killing vashj
bro
why would you do gdkp for those prices
ur getting like 200g split
i got more from p6 AQ40 world chat gdkps
i just dont understand trading your time & possible loot for GOLD
tbc gold
is literally useless
you profit from raiding
aslong ur not chain wiping
what costs a fuck loaD?
50g flask and 2g flame caps
?
if ur engi
you already lost
sure engi is bis if you play dog spec
no?
spellfire gloves are better
yep
spellfire gloves
nope
you use spellfire gloves
sure on melee class maybe
not on warlock
let me know when you do big sapper pulls in tbc
who doesnt have arcane/fire in their raid?
how much % dmg does one add to do alar
im wondering if its worth it to seed them
and one phoenix has 100k hp?
idk
sounds worth it to seed them
when theres like +6 mobs up
you just try to kill them at same time
let pala tank die
:pepebrain:
that was my idea
there arent many cases where destro pot is better than mana pot
when seeding, mana pot is literally always better
idk
pretty often actually have to mana pot on TK trash
id say VR is one of the fights where you destro pot on pull
then mana pot 2 mins later
because of the very specific fight length
if ur seeding and forced to tap
at that point some mobs are already dead
and sapper has lost a lot of value
its not best option
best option for fire is atm tailoring+enchanting
yea bro just tap with full mana
tap to 1k hp and then super sapper in melee range bro
:Pepeclown:
oh i will seed
tap*
but at that point some of the mobs are already dead
so whats the point of sappering
ele can twist right
oh so not worth it then
for VR?
you just need to pray tanks dodge
and insta soulshatter when VR hits you
in speedrun you just chill
idk whats the point of discussing VR speedrun tactics
that boss is all about trying to get 100 parse
Laty assfucking locks
And they take it
You dont sell boota
Boots
Why does laty cuck locks
Does he actually think phys comp is viable
Lock stack gets even better in next tier
Locks ST is actually insane t6, hunters are total dogshit
And you cant just run 15 melees
Well best scaling class in the game
Seed scales with haste
And locks ST is just insane
And are melee class
Needs 10 support classes
Needs hunters
You dont even need eleshamans in t6, but you want atleast 5 shamans
So might aswell run eles
So you want to run +6 healers?
And what are the 2 other shamans
Enhas? Lmao
You will be running 4 healers in t6 anyway
Maybe max 5
Is it?
what is that comp
never going to kill vashj
why sim when you can just feelscraft
:feelcraft:
you never cast drain life
if you die you die
yes
its the best enchant
destro on murlocs
:Pepeclown:
what am i reading
why would you play demo
you need to use scrolls & shit
mages have infinite mana on morogrim
locks need to tap
no other reason really
not really
mages just have infinite mana
locks dont
How do we get seed fixed
@Crix do it, we need to cuck mages
60 seeds
how
im getting 17 seeds
58 incinerate
faster ticks dont bypass aoe cap im pretty sure
wait
hellfire actually viable for mogorim
?
so instead of tapping, you hellfire?
so hellfire does 5.2k dps if aoe cap?
isnt that just better than seeding on morogrim
dont need tap like at all
hellfire not benefitting from crit is kinda yikes tho
does hellfire snap from quags proc?
idk thats pretty good
pretty low for fire lock
+1.5k with buffs
well i had 16 taps on morogrim
so reducing them would be pretty big probably
https://i.nuuls.com/_QG7g.png
what about tlc
does it calculate tlc procs from seeding
if we had skull :pepehands:
could snapshot quags+skull
you dont need to move on morogrim
murlocs are tanked on top of him
ill try it out on sunday if i get quag proc on seeding
any other good trinkets for hellfire
hmmm
you could also maybe snapshot lust
has to be bis
snapshotting lust with hellfire is the play actually
if you can get quag proc when lust is up
should be insane dps
tbh getting quags+lust when murlocs are up
is likely if you do lust at ~20s
do channeled spells have haste cap?
what sapper section
fire locks dont have engi
tailoring+enchanting ofc
bis gloves dead profession?
dont think so
it does? :feelcraft:
that sounds pretty good
you cant trust mages
so do dog whistle dogs soak MCs
or not?
Has anyone tested if dog whistle hounds soak MCs?
actually it does less threat
well not really
you can use ZG neck etc
snapshotting hellfire with drums+lust
sounds pretty good
could even have quags up if lucky
yes but what about snapshotting hellfire with haste stuff
:feelcraft:
rof with haste snapshot
could be good
how often does rof tick
doesnt sound good
maybe with haste snapshots
but even then seed probably better
hellfire ticks faster
i have been thinking about it
TLC might be pretty good for fire
could be bis for normal fire tbh
TLC+eye
well idk
for some reason mages think TLC is good
but they could be just retarded
well can you even roll same
arent decimals just invisible
or are they actually ints?
/roll is ints?
well if its 16 decimals
probably no one has rolled same number yet
why would anyone be aldor :peepohigh:
imagine simming gear
you can just check stats and see whats bis
@JordanF so does dog whistle work
or not
for vashj MCs
can you link log where people use it?
@Falcrist for me its warlock
especially fire warlock
@Davidhow any of the threat reduction, sextant, quag
if ur coe duty
you cast coe
if ur cor duty
you cast cor
simple as that
dont make it hard
then you do it evenly
and if you ever lose to cursing lock
just uninstall
its pretty simple
when ur assigned curse
just do it
dont fuck raid over because you want more personal dps
firelock is more raid dps
thats why we play it
or
you just do coe
and then focus on kill order
dont have to make fight hard
no they dont really
what about mana
has anyone confirmed that dog whistle works
for MC
nah hellfire is only worth it if you snapshot haste effects
and on most trash packs you arent in melee
its only viable on morogrim
math was wrong
seed was 2.5s cast
@Drikkink no fire lock is more raid dps now
well even withb 2 fire locks
well every raid should have atleast 3 locks
preferably atleast 4
thing is, for most people vashj is hardest fight atm
and on that fight fire locks+arc/fire is superior
and if guild is running 2 mages
one should always be arc/fire
well it might sound like  a lot of dps
but imp scorch and fire locks is even more dps
well arcane/fire is much better for p2 too
well it doesnt matter if you have super high dps
and more dps in p2 always helps
less elementals p3, can phase faster etc
arcane mage wants to save mana in p2
not just AB striders
well they will play whatever guild wants
difficulty will be amount of trash
was t6 content nerfed at all?
why is retail somehow harder?
retail and classic raiding is very different
you have a lot more tools in retail
compared to classic
just like in classic
what ceiling
pressing what ur WA tells you to press
and move where your WA tells you to move
is that hard
well go play in some of the best retail guilds
how many would you recruit into top 25 retail guild
moonkin uses green
ele/locks blues
hellfire ticks faster
affli has ruin
well KT can be very hard too if you have way too many melees
vashj will be impossible if you have too many melees
cap & fixate guy in p3
it could be fine-ish
if you can somehow kill cap & fixate guy in time
fixate resets everyones aggro and gives fixate target 10k
if you go above 10k, he targets you
should be able to kill KT
that was because leo aoe was bigger
you just use pala now
do other classes really do shit like this
sure fury pumps with 10 support classes
well you dont need to coe everything on lurker packs
problem is if you take any dmg
gl getting topped off
threat one isnt minor
2% helps on trash when seeding etc
its literally the only enchant does anything at all
you could go?
you never know
well running mageS in first place is a mistake
and now is their peak
mage literally isnt worth bringing over another lock next tier
just use int scrolls
have alt mages do table outside the raid
why? lock deals more dps
hunter pets dont scale from arp
so its over
actual bottom tier next phase
glaive warrior might be beating full t6 bis warlock
well it does, hunters are already dog on total
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1010#metric=dps&partition=2&class=DPS&boss=703&dpstype=wdps
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1010#metric=dps&partition=2&class=DPS&boss=702&dpstype=wdps
its only going to get worse in next phase
4% per glaive afaik
but we are going to have way less resets to get them
locks are god tier both ST&aoe
furys will be god tier st& cleave
sure you might bring 1-2 for MDs
wdym
locks are the most flexible class
literally bring one shaman (which you do anyway) and theyll pump
those few more melees are going to replace hunters
theres never a hastecap for sb/incinerate
unless they make PI & lust stack
youll have 36% haste in swp gear
haste > everything
you go forego everything if you can just get haste
i.e illidans healer cloak is bis
hunters never catch up
thats the funniest thing
t4 was their peak
btw does anyone know if mag is supposed to drop epic gems in BT patch?
nice
beef bar wasnt even top 10 in vanilla
how many yellow epic gems do you get per week roughly
including mag bag
arent swp gems orange haste gems?
really?
https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=47056/quick-lionseye
are you sure
its scaled sands rep and says phase 3
first comment was 2.3.3
and idk, they added CSD day 1
So it could be out
not many pieces have gem bonus from red gems
its mainly yellows
well a lot of pieces are
yeah idk been checking swp gear mainly
idk about t6
well you need 2 blue gems anyway
idk im checking t6 pieces and its mainly yellow gem bonuses
vashj chest has 1 blue gem req
surely this haste belt is bis in t6?
Waistwrap of infinity
idk based on my feelscraft, all haste gear is bis
not really
it says warlock item
everything with spellhaste says warlock item
???
are you going to give moonkin haste ring over a warlock
ur going to do that?
so who then?
ele?
dont make me laugh
spriest?
no i dont think so
why not
when locks are doing 2x the dmg of other casters
going to be hard to give other classes bis warlock loot
well in t6 they will be if you count total dps
well arcane mages arent going to take them anyway
haste dead stat
yeah in late t6
after all warlocks have haste gear already
idk, in my last raid i did 1.74k as cor slave
spriest did 1k, moonkin 851, ele 1088
thats pretty close to 2x
as a cor slave
sure you give all the locks 1 haste ring first
idk
these guys going to give spell haste gear to spriest
well skull is automatically lock prio
or ur guild going to is actually implode
no one is
warrior stack will be meta and not warlock stack ofc
just get 10 glaives
and warrior problem is, do you bring ~13 locks, or 5-6 warriors and 10 support classes for them
well if you have threat issues, all of the melees are already dead
so it wont be a problem
idk
that equation seemed to work correctly on excel
1.24s shadowbolts in swp bis+skull+lust+drums
:feelcraft:
would actually skyrocket crystal prices
it was added 2.4 in original tbc
every comment is 2.3.3 (probably ptr)
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=34872/formula-void-shatter#comments
and its from shattered sun offensive
have to hope bots start running normal dungeons
if you are ever tanking leo or capernian you cant use nether prot
idk
just cast :pepebrain:
hope healers heal you
yap
maybe its time to level that belf lock
thats a good joke
whats skull drop rate?
should be normal item in pool right
illidan drops 2 items right?
https://tbc.wowhead.com/npc=22917/illidan-stormrage
looks like its 2 pools of items, 1/6 or 1/7 chance
so same as chances of getting vestments
4-5 months and your going to see like 3-4 skulls
more if your lucky
or 28 nefarians until you see crul
or doing 52 onyxias and never seeing DB
but thats pretty unlikely
but seen like 2 or 3 fangs already
its all rng
its not :pepebrain: might aswell practice for next phase
any wanders?
spriest sniping isb?
sure you can
sure it is
doesnt necessarily stop them from doing it
rof is shorter duration so snapshotting is worse
around 1500 with lust
swp is like 36% spell haste
from gear alone
1.2s shadow bolts with all cooldowns in swp bis
ehh we might be casting incinerates in swp anyway
well see
if (big if) you bring a mage
well you will use it until you have 4pc t6
well thats pretty big
did some locks actually do hellfire meme?
i heard shoulders are best offpiece if you dont have vestments
surely eye is better
or motc
imagine playing wotlk
have fun doing naxx 25 for 5 months
im not playing wotlk
i will be finally free from this game
bro raid will be full of DKs and furys
only mage sims are wrong
t5 legs is free loot soon
surv hunters want
wiping the raid because you want to do a bit more dps sounds very hunter thing
idk corruption isnt just worth it
i wouldnt even bother casting immolate if i didnt have 4pc t4
movement doesnt matter
immolate is either more dmg per cast or it isnt
what if 4pc t5 affects every corruption :pepebrain:
has anyone tested that
skull will be multiple gold caps, ur not getting it without rmt
99 on morogrim is impossible if ur in even half decent guild
like if you kill it with 2 murloc waves
ur not getting 99
this is literally mages peak
they are decent-ish t6
and fall off a cliff in swp
fang is good enough
arcane mage is shit
why would anyone play class that needs support classes
??
is it actually fun to beg for innervate
yes you do?
thats pure copium dude
speedruns will have 0 mages
0 mages swp
mb 1 in t6
even in normal comps
int scroll is 1g
no
if you want to parse, tell ur raid to go afk for 5 minutes
be the only one seeding
@Skycrab KT legendary sword is actually insane
that legendary sword is probably better than glaives, and if ur unlucky KT can get healer mace buff too
yep warp slicer actually better than glaives
meanwhile casters get dogshit staff
haste potion :peepohigh:
chernobyl is perfect example why communism doesnt work
its p2
why would you speedrun kara
thats like speedrunning mc when bwl is out
no?
no one has done that
no they didnt
just get HKM cloak
belf lock, thats based
pala tank facetank no problem with block set
haste belt for me :pepebrain:
haste bis stat
mages dont have any loot in t6
you are not going fire before every lock has spell haste gear
so gl
arcane in p5 , thats a good one
(if you even run a mage in p5)
well casual guilds want to run mages even less in swp
they have to hit dps requirements
well muru is hard for people who had trouble on vashj or KT
probably every swp fight will be hard
bro
solarian wand is warlock bis next phase
its warlock loot
in actually good guilds you give illidan cloak to resto shamans so you can cut healers
being able to run 3/4 healers instead of 5 is pretty big
well you can always cut hit somewhere probably
to get to 164
well getting skull will be hard
why is mage asking this
ZD isnt as good as skull lmao
not even close
spriests take the trash mace and they will be happy.
you will see more than one trash mace
ZD isnt that big
you lose Sp, get spell haste
so what?
do you lose dps if you go over hit cap?
so?
its still more sp
other casters can use trash mace
and they will be happy
???
bro
moonkin will be 1/3 of ur dps
elemental 1/2
glaives most overrated item i have ever seen
i thought it was actually big, but its just orange
pretty sure glaives arent even swp bis
and lock is doing +3.5k on ST in swp
@Itsmarco thats a gquit
actually, ur guild is going to implode
just leave now
skull drama will be great
give it to any non warlock and you lose warlocks
peak kino
hit is wasted on arcane mages, spell haste is wasted on arcane mage
both lock prio
bro sure you do
with 13% from talents
wow 10%?
even locks will have trouble dropping hit
you cant really drop ele shamans
or you run too many healers
ehh pretty sure ele is more dps
so is enha
mages arent good after this tier tho
only reason to bring them is if you dont want to buy int scrolls
locks need one literal spriest in raid
idk if you can call that needing support
you kinda want to replace hunters with melee
so switching shamans to melees too, thats going to super melee heavy
yeah for MD
not for dps
yes it does
because of hunter % dmg auras
well fury is actually good in next tier
and hunters arent
yes you do
you dont give resto shaman % dmg buffs
:Pepeclown:
sure
hunters arent great in next tier
thats why you want to run some melees right now
why would you run 2 mages
one lock would be so much better
mage sim :Pepeclown:
whats grp 4?
is this one of those 30s sims?
240s and mages doing 2.3k dps?
i doubt that
so why bring up sims
especially mage sims
which is the biggest meme there is
topic is what? where moonkin should be? well answer is simple, in warlock group
should you have moonkin in raid? no
you should have one more warlock
if you have 4 destros, you need to run one in spriest group
unless you cut a moonkin
moonkin is basically wasted on spriest and its wasted on resto shaman
you need to run it in warlock grp
rshaman is best healer ingame
best scaling one too
it is
priest brings nothing to raid
well expect hps
one more bloodlust is one more bloodlust
simple as that
no?
thats paladin and resto druid
shaman is besthealer
then ur shamans suck
ofc you would bring resto shamans, you always want atleast 5 shamans in raid
well if you think rshaman is a bad healer, i actually cant help you
so utility doesnt make healer better?
only hps matters?
2x CoH priests isnt that good
stacking shamans is way better
they are good heals tho?
while bringing the best utility
they are?
2-3 coh is grief
one is already enough to top raid
well if rshamans didnt have utility you would bring more resto druids
they atleast have innervate
maybe one disc priest
well you can run 4 healers now
very risky tho
you always have kings
3rd pala is wisdom/salv on healers
are melees using LAP & pvp trinket?
it is for sure
5 heal is superior on every fight
yes always go ruin
tear is actually bis until wotlk :pepehands:
never got it
actually warlock is just better mage
if you see melee hitting strider throw a net
on illhoof focus boss until theres a lot of imps
and then seed on illhoof
just gquit dude
stop being cucked
let mages do curses
2 locks is never fine
unless you dont mind them quitting
bro
would you raid if you were on curse assign every week?
i wouldnt
gl minmaxing trash dps on curse duty
200-300 globals wasted
you can coa
does it actually?
i thought it just makes you hit aoe cap sooner
how much dmg would seed be doing in that scenario if the bug was fixed?
1508 per mob?
blizz better fix this eventually
why bother with candies, one crit in fight is more dps
:peepohigh:
tailoring should be better
imagine playing wotlk
blizz will own you forever if you do that
@Genemcgrath (Crazykarl) he comes up when all adds are dead
You will use hyjal mace and be happy.
Yes you will
KT was full rng tho
bug was either always wipe or nonfactor
depending on ur rng
sp/haste only
call wipe if any resists or low crit
imagine gearing arabs
leveling is fun but fuck doing reputations
bro just get 0 stam gloves
OH NO NO
nah, im cucked to shadow now
its over
i had seed set even when i was fire
switching sacs & sets wasnt a problem
mages griefing ofc
pressing scorch was too hard for them
yea shooting shadow bolts which are 10% slower cast and hit less half of the time is "fun"
easiest way to handle them is not bringing any melee
yeah bro, because u got orange in vanilla that means you have prio on tbc orange too :pepebrain:
it basically is
BT+hyjal for 2 long phases sounds brutal
dont see casual guilds surviving it
idk guys, just get lucky
we have like 5-6 swords from 2 raids already
going to mages soon
next phase it could very well be viable
but next phase you can have fire mage too
so idk
i have 4pc t4, ofc ill immo on VR
corruption is 30 range hard to precast
immolate is way better
idk, in decent guild vashj dies way too fast
you dont almost have any mana problems
you gotta make sure dagger debuff is at 5 stacks
melees like to grief us and just put up few stacks
what arcane loot?
theres 0 arcane mage loots in t6
thing is, this phase is absolutely warlocks weakest
especially if shadow on bosses
have you checked glaive stats?
literally not even that good
KT weapon is way better
KT legendary weapon
and furys arent pumping that hard, even when they have free 2 mob cleave
while locks are dpsing with shit uptime
and even getting glaives is super hard
5% based on my research
so is warlock gear
t6 first phase where we get actual upgrades
leo actually the hardest boss in whole game :pepebrain:
how do we get seed fixed
REEEEE
calculates main target on aoe cap, so we are doing like 10% less dmg
yep just get vestments
and curse duty is 200-300 dps loss
so what
bro laty just wants to cuck warlocks
you give spriest to healers in 4 healer comp, one ele shaman can offheal some fights
morogrim is doable with 4 healers
running druid for FF is grief
you run 1 pala+1holy priest+2restos
if going 4 heal
fire lock can have 10k hp easily
if you have hp rings
solarian packs are aoe capped
doesnt matter rly
wait using hellfire? :Pepeclown:
thought they were using spellfire gear
yeah getting legendary in vanilla means you get p3 bis in tbc 🤡
if locks were squishy, all of your healers & mages were squishy too
t4 chest is pretty fucking dogshit
and shadow gear is dogshit
hellfire is good if you snapshot lust+quags
bro?
snapshotting isnt a meme
no its not if you snapshot haste effects
RoF is 8s
hellfire 15s
just shadowburn
idk whats the problem
so?
doesnt do conflag instantly
we use soaker anyway
just use soakers, 3rd tank is useless anyway
you still use JC necks even if you have KT neck
so they want to do less dps?
why do they play dps class
boomkin wears green neck
JC necks are literally free
60-80g for 10 charges
bis for crit set
why would you ever take searing pain
dont need it, also palas should be tanking it
more value than imp sp
sappers? incinerate on fire vulnerability giants
engi is mainly for rocket boots
everything else is whatever
its worth it if you snapshot haste effects
lust/quags/bowiz
@Helsa you wait for next phase
its simple, no 5 procs on pack before
you call wipe
wait 20 mans
mins*
capernian tank is whatever
you have 100% uptime
bro
actually prot pala is in the healer grp
and who do you cuck out of the grp
sp group is usually combo of 3 mages/locks
and where do you put the lock?
then you can run 5 locks easily
isnt water shield better anyway
you are popping mana pot when seeding
yea
well if you use icon
i have been using TLC+eye but not sure if its worth it, we have only 2 murloc waves
nah sextant is for sure better than TLC
@Kristofer stop misgendering her
do you have imp scorch?
if you have imp scorch, just go fire
@Thrillshire prot pala has 100sp totem? could also have hunters doing MD sapper
imagine playing hunter and not scrolling pet
griefing
he thinks large prismatics wont crash in p5
ioh no no no
probably playing pala
boosting groups
but what if you have free taps
then cataclysm is useless
why would you relvl tailor
its not mage trinket
its lock trinket
well destructive reach doesnt work on seed
mage forgetting locks need to curse
on aoe packs every lock should coe
paladin MT and druid OT on bosses will be the meta in t6 most likely
what people pug it with 15
ofc 20 can clear it
bro people pug it with 15
wings is helm
its better on locks
why wouldnt you take it
And ele should be mainly using JC necks anyway
Its for the crit when aoe capped
but yeah sextant is just better
@Aloysius ok explain how my point is very stupid
@Aloysius thing is, warlocks scale better from crit and usually raid has only one arcane mage who beats locks
and ele sometimes even uses green JC necks
yep i was right
and you started arguing
so cba
they are doing it for trinkets probably
no way atiesh is worth it
yea in 4 warlock grp its worth it but idk
not worth the hours
its 100% worth it in 4 warlock grp
but 3 lock+moonkin+ele?
its close
its harder to fuck up with one on-use + eye
well you are almost always getting one proc during lust
not that it matters with lust & quags, you would want proc during trinket
i dont see whats the problem on curse proc
you can cast other shit faster
lust & quags proc dont affect each other
i just hate using 2x on-use trinkets
next phase is fun, quags+motc until skull
well sextant will be worse than quags next phase
quag scales with ur dps
12-14s i think
just get lucky guys
still no vestments tho
:peepohigh:
missing boots of blasting+vestments+t5 legs from full bis
feels like wrists,wand and sword drops every week
not even spriest wants cowl in our guild
even though im pretty sure their bis
well you should theoretically give it to affli if hes usually in resto shaman grp
btw is it 100% confirmed t5 bonus doesnt buff other warlocks immolate/corruption?
well its still base dmg, so wouldnt be massive
but probably bis
healer ring*
and those shit mail boots
hit and haste both low value on arcane
unlucky
pala tank if he start maintanking
(which he should)
yes
KT is mechanics fight
vashj is straight up dps race
@Hathos probably every lock uses oblivion set in those runs
its bis on pretty much every seed pack
unless your raid perfectly splits dmg and kills everything same second
yes lurker trash is capped until some of the mobs die
only place where its not probably worth it is solarian packs
but might aswell use it
i wonder if its worth using next phase
shooting 5k shadow bolts is pretty :peepohigh:
https://i.nuuls.com/ZDUN5.png
he was in healer grp most of the time, was in 2nd melee grp on bosses where he needs threat tho
well 50k sustained raid dps just isnt possible atm
3 is probably better if ur wearing obvilion set
shadow bolt hits are very low with oblivion set
tailor+enchanting swp bis
ur leveling engi mainly for rocket boots
speedruns
only reason to go engi really
yea its for speedrun guilds mainly
ring is boe
@YawningAngel warlock > fury > other classes
yes im the real hannu
hyjal is also pretty good for seeding
but yeah pets dont gain anything from arp
so its not looking good for hunters
if we get spell haste gems next phase, it wont even be close
nah 10 haste gems are from mount hyjal vendor
was added in 2.4 tho
but we got CSD in p1 so its hard to say whats going to happen
locks will be shooting 1.2s shadow bolts with all the cds
it wont even be close
or 1.1s incinerates
hunters peaked in p1
are decent this phase
and fall off t6+
illidan had 25m hp on pservers?
also no glaives for hunters
which melees will need to compete with locks
hydross is melee unfriendly?
you can barely get a seed off on solarian adds
literally nonfactor
and still most warlocks right now are cucked to shadow
which deals around 5-10% less ST dps
how are t5 fights awful for hunters?
what fight is awful for hunters?
warlocks are literally losing 10% boss dps because mages dont want to scorch
most hunters have 100% minmaxed phys debuffs
only VR is bad fight for hunters
literally every other fight is 100% uptime
ABC - always be casting
we do t4+t5 in 1 day
mag is the hardest boss in whole game :peepohigh:
TK+ssc in 3h sounds very hard
0 wipes etc
nah its actually the hardest boss in whole game
well then they cant make it
unlucky
yea mages are going to be top dps next tier
:peepohigh:
they fall off next tier hard
0 upgrades
its not in 99.9% of guilds
because mages like to grief the raid
IV isnt 100% uptime
when IV isnt up, arc fire and frost are literally the same
@GAMING WARLORD well what does arc/frost gain when IV isnt up?
what filler?
mages barely cast any fillers even in frost
it doesnt
yep thats why speedruns will be running 12 mages
and 1 curse bot lock
oh and 4 spriests and 12 druids
in speedrun you kinda want to give healers spriest so idk
you bring one mage to pop seeds
because blizzard ofc cant fix any of the seed bugs
only losing 10% dps on aoe cap
no big deal
fucking dogshit company fix the seed bug
:peepohigh:
well i havent seen any speedrun running only 4 healers yet
which is eventually going to happen
i dont understand this resto with imp FF meme
why wouldnt you just run 4 healers
bring a real dps
in warlock stack you could even cut hpala
run 3 resto shamans+holy priest
or 2x holy priests+2 resto shamans
safety isnt that big issue in tbc
no dmf weeks or anything
can always go next week
or just dont do chicken memes
waste of time
@nobbisjunior 0 stam vs 56 stam
if that ~700-750 hp saves you once in a 10 raids
youll do more dps
well 48 stam
its yea like 600
kings+talents
and dps wise we are looking at very small difference
just take the stamina
what tank grp
hunter feral one?
you dont want to multilust hunters in that fight
imagine gearing arabs when you could just do cloth cds+primal might cd+dailies
@Existing Hours bracers next phase but its boe, bop chest in sunwell
sunfire robe
bro
its straight up bis
and not even close
well if we look at only one item slot
its not even close
t5 legs vs wboss legs is very minimal difference
just take the t5 legs
ehh pala should tank it
especially in a speedrun
pala is better leo tank in every way
can go full sp gear, can drop stacks
if you dont have time to switch a sac, at that point arcane mage has some seriously troubles too
and if you go at that speed, healers start getting problems too
and need spriest
you dont need to be shadow for lurker trash
can you fish mages?
havent seen any top guilds do speedruns yet tbh
soulfrost oh no no no
ur supposed to enchant 30 int
more crit too
seed has absolute shit sp scaling
well you shouldnt be using bowiz then
laundering rmt gold again probably
maitoz cucked someone
not sure if it was kadet
he wanted to be the only scarab mount owner in the guild
apes was grabbing wbuffs for world #1300 AQ clear
instead of helping their guildie
peak of the wow, first alliance tried to grief horde but failed
and then losing 3 mounts
too bad laty thought hunters would be best class in tbc :peepohigh:
over for salad bakers
salad bakers cant complain tbh
edited logs
and then they again edited logs to get nhars #1
and they cry about kihra being corrupted
oh but i do know the truth
well they removed all the vods for some reason
and later edited logs to get nhars #1
so why wouldnt have they removed petri use
i dont even get casts off on eles
they die way too fast
@Crix on what other bosses will we use nets?
so why put it in the infographic
prot pally is MT next tier
can blizzard fucking fix arcanite dragonling and seed bug
REEEE
vashj can be very hard if you have low raid dps
isnt crusade worse than eye
poopsockers will have motc
@Itsmarco go read wowhead comments my dude
it wont work
does the bigger one work on raid mobs?
or does it deal no dmg to  incapacitate immune mobs?
@Louki does grenade work on every mob?
in vanilla didnt deal dmg to most raid mobs
he was talking about grenades
how does the bigger one work? can you use it with tap
and shares 1 min CD with sappers ?
@Michael wait really?
our guild has like 6 belt of blasting patterns
dogshit vashj loot is so :peepohigh:
krakken-heart and plate healing gloves
nice one
:peepohigh:
its just too hard to keep imp alive
!mgi
hard troll
yea fire ele on murlocs and then seeds start missing
:peepohigh:
dont press fire ele as ele
you seed on morogrim
and anyway its 3% crit
then murlocs dont die evenly
you cant complain macro, we got healing plate gloves and plate chest 🙂
ABC
if your rl tells you to switch, you dont switch
ABC
2015 dps today on coe duty
:peepohigh:
sure it will keep succubus alive
(it wont)
https://maarslet.github.io/DebuffCheck/
mages just leech the raid and cant even beat coe locks
bowiz just isnt worth it
you can easily waste the proc on seed packs
losing crit, shitload of sp
and its harder to play optimally
actually fang user
saw like 4 drop in a row
0 FR
why would you want to see tank?
next phase you go for haste set
instead of oblivion
wboss pants are literally a meme
idk about u guys but im not losing 650 hp for literal 1-2 dps
!xelrog
morogrim is the only place where you can hellfire
on solarian if your lucky you get 2 seeds off
ur supposed to be on tanks ass and insta curse after the pull
if you want to die sure
shadow lock is all about crit
go heavy on crit
based on my feelscraft
on firelock you dont have to care about crit
in tbc that wont work
max parsing is fire anyway
2-3 lusts
everything cucks our parses
being shadow already cucks parses
no?
hunter is dog
hunters are there only for MD
those furies should be warlocks
but probably still coping
hunters fall off next phase
mages fall off next phase
why bring them
hate hunters and mages
simple as that
its 6 mobs
most guilds sheep 2
ehh let the mages pump this phase
0 upgrades next phase for them
blizz fucked up tbc so hard
we should have BT out by now
hyjal was out day 1
BT came out like 3 months later?
yea but doom locks shouldnt be losing to coe/cor lock
@Valethar well original hyjal attunement was way harder, vashj&kt both dropped like 4-5 vials i think
and vashj&kt would have been VERY brutal if we didnt have 5 months of t4
blizz fucked up hard
stop running affli
its not worth it
mages literally rather wipe the raid than decurse
will be fun to see how many mages will decurse in hyjal
flame caps arent expensive
no
you really want meta gem
??? as fire lock you always flame cap
t5 legs are bis
this is the warlocks weakpoint
and mages peak
both mages&furies need like 5 support classes
warlocks need nothing
@Skycrab thats straight up lie
show me a fury without 2x bm,feral and enha
show me one
so show us logs of one fury without that grp setup
fury needs those classes
show me logs where fury doesnt have that grp
spriest is always in the raid
unless ur running only physical dps
sure you can stack furies, will they beat warlocks at that point? no
skycrab ur insane
furies literally need the most support both in grp & raid to perform
out of any class
you can stack 12 warlocks without any problems
all of them will deal insane dps
enh is floor pov
idk if you want to run 2
5 healing with 3 resto shamans ofc
bringing resto druid is grief
one more lust or innervate?
easy choice
how many top guild has even done speedruns yet?
progress is just doing splits
@Anon (gen) just need enough ranged dps to kill thaladred & capernian fast enough in p3
more you have better it is ofc
its hard to gem haste gem
just use CSD
just feelcraft it
tanking striders is a meme
just let ele shaman kite
you take less dmg? safer strat
not really
you have 100% uptime even when using kite strat
@Solah we run 4 destros
affli is barely worth it
thats not even close to bis
https://i.nuuls.com/YFnEH.png
https://seventyupgrades.com/character/5HRtLd1Gnwimz5miZwDsYd/set/pnqQU25dCRswq7ECFiQZdR
this is swp bis based on my feelscraft
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/9PkLZeR3U9fxBCaaxq38zK
getting hit from neck allows you to use heart of the pit
you replace all the tbc gear instantly in wotlk
stat inflation is insane
(not that anyone is going to play wotlk, its doa)
you use conflag as finisher
especially nice on trash
yeah popping 20g on scrolls after every death is fun
:Pepeclown:
hunters arent good
fury is better
insane?
not insane
warlock is insane
most guilds hard cuck warlocks and still they top
no double lusts, no imp scorch
no?
guys just roll fury if ur going to play wotlk
2h is harder to play optimally
kebab is easy
most people here will never see 2 glaives drop
i wouldnt count on it
nah ill pass on that shit
why would you bring a rogue to speedrun
you want to go as fast as possible
so why bring a rogue
top speedrun right now is stacking hunters
we just gotta wait for real guilds speedruns
1900 dps is a lot?
and thats a pure ST class
in what grp was he
did he have enha?
did he have hunters too then?
rogue has a spot in TK speedrun
theres no way coe on morogrim adds is worth it
could have used those globals to either nuke boss or seed
its not worth it,
you could have used those globals on morogrim
and murlocs have 70k hp
at best coe is doing 7k dmg
seed is 14k
killing them makes the kill faster?
you have every platform kill their ads
adds
just dont stay in their melee range
bro boss has 3.9m hp
lust and kill it
skarp is clueless
just go check world first mother kill
literal 11 mins
to dps down 3.9m hp
they had crafted SR gear
probably
bigger question is how prismatic shield will work
idk most people did t6 post nerf
like most people did t5 post nerf
hard to say how hard BT will be
mother shazrah was changed atleast
how prismatic shield works etc
double health would have made fight interesting tbh
yeah
optimal comp
i kinda doubt that tbh
BT is long as fuck
in original tbc and their raid dps
it must have taken forever
i think that was added in 2.3
or 2.4
but in classic they will nerf t5 and probably can skip to KT/vashj
vashj with no MC will be such a joke
btw can you skip HKM
or have to kill it before gruul?
should add naxx to that list
it is
druid better in every way
and next phase paladin is better in every way
!xelrog
i had my oblivion set like day 3 of tbc
all 5 pieces
@bbq / tl419 save it for t6 shoulders
or ur going to regret it
i have one in t4 shoulders and going to put 2nd one on t6
like 24?
maybe 30
ur never going to get that low
https://i.nuuls.com/hWA4E.png
this is my seed set
actually cant drop any hit
4pc oblivion isnt mental for sure
10 crit for sure
eye of the night has 25 crit
its bis for seeding
that shows backlash?
mine doesnt i think
bro show ur items
dont have any other crit OH
marco when you are you beating me on total
with all those bis items
my 2k was on coe duty too ofc
4 in casual comps
you should start looking for the new guild already marco
sb dead after odaal takes skull
not even biggest cucks will stay after that
gearing latys alts
fetish is overrated right now, very hard to use because of 30s CD
you want vashj trinket
fetish should be very good in hyjal tho
its massive threat reduction on crits
you want it
yea its 600
after all the other reductions right
everything isnt capped
some mobs might have shit threat(like cross in our raids usually but you can just seed on that)
why would you precast
when you could do 2x coe
then seed
and never die
how are you even preseeding with 30 range
if you use fetish/eye ur missing trinket on half of the pulls
if you think fury is ever going to use prism
ur delusional
they rather die to over aggro
nothing wrong with 2 hunters
btw wheres my brown role :peepohigh:
its not worth it
if you have affli its enough
you should never have only 2 locks
well forcing them to cast shadow bolts when raid has imp scorch is easy way to lose more locks
isb uptime is going to be dogshit with only 1-2 locks anyway
not really
fine? anything below 80% is hard grief
idk we are pretty close
with 4 locks
75-85% isb uptime for us
85% on VR
56% sounds horrible
is someone wanding?
https://maarslet.github.io/DebuffCheck/
use this to check isb uptime
if ur using oblivion set  i would seed 3 mobs
but if using normal set i wouldnt seed
wheres my brown name
mother had 3.9m hp on world first kill
no?
how does that make sense
i dont think it works like that
pretty sure external effects are calculated when it hits
your buffs are calculated when spell leaves the hands
but it works same in opposite way too, if ISB gets applied when shadow bolt is in air
doesnt boost dmg?
so it doesnt affect ISB uptime?
:feelcraft:
you will be using motc+quags until skull
then you use skull+motc
why? because mages want to grief the raid
icy veins is good if you pull slowly
if ur chain pulling uptime is dog
100 parses are literally irrelevant
difference on arc/frost and fire isnt that big
if you arent swapping gear in a speedrun are you really speedrunning?
well then you are in a shit guild
and shouldnt even think of speedrunning
you just need to get used to switching sets
it becomes 2nd nature very fast
ehh theres 3 sets you realistically use
oblivion,low hit and boss set
yes the solarian packs
everywhere else oblivion is better
will depend on packs/pulls a lot
if you have to cast any shadow bolts at all probably will want to use t6
sappers and bombs are whatever for lock
only reason to go engi is rocket boots
we could be getting haste gems too
tbc professions are easy to lvl
was way harder in vanilla
you keep enchanting always
swp goggles pattern will be a raid drop
and doesnt look that good tbh
head is one of the better places to keep t6 set bonus too
will be a while before you get all swp pieces
nah shoulders is
head is wings
6% dmg on incinerate :pepebrain:
1.1s incinerates in swp bis
hopefully we get spell haste gems in next phase
like CSD was p3?
10 haste gems were added to hyjal vendor
in 2.4
So we could be getting them next phase
why wouldnt you farm swp?
its peak of tbc
its all downhill after swp
it depends
minmaxing guilds will clear it week 1
prenerf vashj & KT are very hard compared to everything else until now
it would be retarded so they just might
t6 wont be easier tbh
BT is long ass raid
hyjal will be brutal if you have shit aoe
if they dont want to lose players they should release t6 asap
TLC doesnt feel good because of 2s cast time
if ur unlucky and dont get 3 crits on seeds, value plummets
yeah on morogrim is good
but generally on aoe? id say no
imagine seeing vestments drop
every week its the fucking healer ring
:peepohigh:
im probably going 12sp and 2x 9sp gems on vashj chest
i already have epics on my belt of blasting
so would have to use 4crit+5sp oranges
1.3k for 6/6
thats how much i get from doing few dailies
i think it might work on fatal attraction
and on dot beam maybe?
you want coe on all mobs
expect technicians
yea multiple locks should be doing coe on seed packs
it literally is on some seed packs where mobs have a lot of health
murlocs,leo packs and lurker packs
skulling seed is the play if ur not pulling aggro while doing that
usually have to seed on cross
optimal group in som has 1 warlock casting cor
didnt need robe?
thats ur bis
not having isb and casting shadow bolts actually destroys ISB uptime
i heard mages want toc
i have been spying in their discord
locks to losing to furies
idk
bro
why are locks dying to spout
id look into getting new warlocks
why would anyone apply to nota
it unironically is
atleast im not playing in poopsocker guild stacking warriors in tbc
p3 speedruns is warlocks
@yonka did you know oblivion set is pretty good for speedrunning?
@gremmer🐢 only see one guy using it on logs, could be bugged tho idk
mages sword, pala/ele/spriest mace and locks ZD
easy
arcane mages want toc ?
spell haste pretty much wasted on arcane mage
people will run 2 tanks+4healers eventually
doomie?
bro haste break point :feelcraft:
wtf is doomie??
is ZD even spriest bis actually
losing a lot of sp
im pretty sure ZD isnt even spriest bis
mace+OH has to be better
wtf does spriest do with haste?
cast their dots faster?
in my last raid, spriest did 17% of their dmg with mind flay
theres no way haste is a good stat for spriest
compared to warlock
mace
mace+OH is 278 sp and s3 spellblade + OH is 289 sp (and some crit+hit). ZD is 259 sp based on my feelscraft theres no way ZD is spriest bis
nah
Toc+haste OH has to be better
sure you take ToC
isnt archimonde normal loot table like vashj and KT? 1/6
1/6 to get ToC doesnt sound that bad
spriest takes the mace or pvp dagger
hit will be wasted on everyone
50 hit :peepohigh:
you have to give ZD to lock tbh
anyone else is pure grief
@JordanF it is for sure
3 gem sockets is 30 haste
yea
look at the stats
well actually its close
ZD probably better if you cant cut hit anywhere else
??? doing more raid dps made you hate warlocks?
right now most raids are doing less raid dps because mages grief the raid
@Shanu no fire locks WERE and ARE raid dps increase
and WILL be
in swp shadow might be raid dps upgrade if ISB uptime is good
how does arcane itemize?
or not getting any lusts
if you dont give arcane any lusts, they could go for haste
@JordanF on swp gear you want to go for gem socket bonuses
based on my feelscraft bis list i use 10 haste over oranges
i dont trust sims and haste
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/525ik1qVYJyQy5Uzj1mwPU
and haste is always better for seeding
so you kinda want to go for haste
SoM is doa
blizzard should wake the fuck up and release T6
SoM is the ultimate you think you do but you dont
people think they want harder vanilla content but do they want to chain wipe because you have few bad players in 40 man raid?
and then farm consumables
not really
you could argue you can socialise more in 25 man raid
compared to 40
websim doesnt have enchants?
how do i add enchants?
oh
no wonder numbers felt low
swp will be pretty fun guys
catabolt is the spec in p3-p5
if ur playing shadow
buffs are fine
equipped items dont show rings
is this known bug?
or am i blind
alliance doesnt have resto shamans
:peepohigh:
toc+oh makes getting upgrades in swp easier
hard to get sunflare or heart of the pit if ur ZD user
looks like shadow will be bis next phase even if you have imp scorch
(with 80 isb uptime)
based on websim
yea in p2 sure and yeah 80% isb might be too high
and with shadow you can get nether protection
which should be good
5-6 will be perfectly normal in next phase
when non purples dont even show up on meters
locks lose a lot of crit in next phase
so 80% might be unrealistic
im simming ZD
which seems to be 20 dps ahead
no
boomkin isnt ass boosts isb :pepebrain:
and brings imp FF
you really dont want to be running resto druid in next phase
@IStandinFire i was talking about p3
i was talking about p3 bis
and for progression you kinda want nether protection
well you can hit 85% if lucky
on pw
what does rdruid bring to a raid?
pala brings a blessing
rshaman brings best heals AND bloodlust
holy priest brings only heals
rdruid brings nothing
does hyjal trash waves all have same hp amount
or will some mobs die earlier?
bro salv always
always
U guys unlucky
running mage in p3
spriests look like that???
skull is like 100 dps for warlock
over 2nd best
it is with bis setup
you get exact 164 hit with skull
investigate what?
dont die
dont be on curse duty
get oblivion set
then ur #1 dps
whats the problem
TK can easily drop 0 warlock items
imagine getting 99 on morogrim
week 1?
nah
99 impossible if you are in decent raid
mana pot for sure
most poopsocker guilds did ptr for like 100 hours
why 3x bm in resto grp??
put enha in there
problem is resto doesnt do anything with 9% extra dmg
enha does
mages get sick trinket p6
t6*
@Itsmarco dude hes going to take skull
find a new guild
mgq mage trinket and skull
hes going to hit 0.5s AE
@Ryusei yes i know im just memeing
also people dont have 3 trinket slots
mana pot is more dps in most cases
i destro potted on hydross last week
had to tap around with lust running
never doing destro again
locks always get prio over priest
only prot pala should get prio on t6 over warlock in some cases
no only if you make prot pala main tank you should give him prio
which you should do ofc
but if hes not maintanking literally useless t6
no?
like current content?
paladins dont have any problems right now
especially on aoe capped packs
IDS is there to boost arcane mages parses
if ur running 6 healers doesnt really matter
!bathwater
3 priests
wtf
can you do solo farm in fresh id
or need to clear to some boss?
some guilds will do trash farm
dont even need to solo
meta will be zerging it down anyway
3.9m hp
maybe go some SR from gear
p6 is wotlk
this is t6 talk
what are jannies doing
on total or boss?
@Lexolas its still pretty big difference
around 150 dps even without spellfire
next phase shadow is equal with high isb uptime
i think i have seen 1 ring 1 vestments
:peepohigh:
id use t4 gloves
you always want 2pc t4
also bannable (if blizz cared)
same faction griefing is bannable
(IF BLIZZ CARED)
haste works on skinning?
herbing'?
idk about this shit
i just do dailies and sell badges of tenacity
why kill trees
no coe/cor in gdkp is the play
why wouldnt you give cut for coe/cor
i wouldnt press it for free
nades are only up if you need to tap
nah
shoulders good for seeding
engi isnt good for ST
engi is only good for rocket boots
you only want engi if ur in speedrun guild
sappers arent that good on lock
the bigger one is better
wait really?
well adamantite grenades then
not having ptr is good
@Decrepit/Palypanzer does prot pala grp have resto shaman?
you should put afllilock in spriest grp then
@Stabile did u guys test it?
does it buff other warlocks corruption / immolate
i dont think holy can keep aggro
so its never been tested?
anyone have 4pc t5?
:peepohigh:
23 sp
mana pot if you dont have free taps
destro if you have free taps
you want to avoid tapping at all costs
expect if you have movement (free taps)
when talking about no trash KT, do you kill one pack or somehow skip all 3?
no one really has 4pc t5??
:peepohigh:
its week 8
someone has to have it
:peepohigh:
4pc t5 might be bis even next phase if it buffs every locks corruption / immolate
no every lock would use it
and more locks you had, better it would be
vest is scuffed for seeding
@spoar taunt ?
really?
this is arcane mages peak
warlocks got literally nothing in t5
and most actually lost dps because mages decided to cuck us
pretty sure weapon disappears if you die or something
could work with DI maybe
cataclysm is way overrated
its literally useless for trash
nether prot will be nice next phase
right now its pretty useless
its only useful on KT?
you should fix that
enha doesnt even show up on meters
why do spriests even want haste?
whats wrong with mace+oh
whats wrong with pvp weapon+oh
both more sp
so?
warlocks would do more dps with that haste
and im pretty sure if they just went full sp they would do more dps
idk shadoweave shoulders are a lot of sp
74 sp vs 44 sp and 38 haste
if i was spriest, id take shadoweave shoulders
warlock might aswell go for crit cloak
isb uptime is pretty important
give haste cloaks to shamans
so they can 4 heal
just solo farm
wait trash mace can drop from BT too?
why wouldnt spriest take trash mace
well ofc it depends how often it drops
you can give ToC to pala too if hes maintanking
ZD spriest isnt going to happen
toc paladin is good if hes MT
(which he should be ofc)
sure
let me know how many warlocks you lose too
pissing off warlocks next phase is smart
:pepebrain:
yep
fury is almost going to beat warlock in swp
so that makes sense
zd+skull is exactly 164 hit
in full bis next phase
yea one iirc
https://i.nuuls.com/yhY7U.png
neltharions tear is swp bis on 70 upgrades
:Pepeclown:
@Montclaire 28 is good number for one raid with barely any wipes
if speedrunning id take like 50-60
wow comments say HsH is 11% drop chance
gl seeing it
11% is just brutal
im pretty sure those werent 11%
deathbringer was 8% and i literally didnt see any drop in 53 kills
@Ryusei 2 drops, 13 items
im pretty sure it wasnt 11%
i dont trust the % loot table says
i trust wowhead comments
is ZA weekly reset
or 3 days
oh 3 days helps a lot
nota is coping
well there are quite few posts about it being rare
but if its 3 days reset
wont matter really
so did anyone test the 4pc t5 yet?
does it buff other warlocks corruption/immolate
if your guild is good 99 vashj is very hard
less uptime in p2
i afk like 40s p2
How do you even get to 5.5% hit
im running 145 hit in my trash set
spellstrike legs with 3 crit gems is a lot of crit
im going to use that after i get t5 legs
hydross chest with crit gems is just fine
i have both in my bank :pepebrain:
6 stam+5 crit one too
do you use 4pc t4?
you should 100% use corruption & immolate then
idk if siphon life is worth
probably not
you have 100sp totem atleast?
well not having 100sp is a big problem
very big problem
well affli is always on coe duty
that alone hurts ur dps
and not having shaman at all
could be using 4pc t5
Thats the only situation where i would prio corruption&sb over immolate as affli
is that 2 retri paladins?
yea holy is the last healer you put to spriest group
holy pala*
you should switch prot and holy pala atleast
or switch holy priest & holy pala
t6 @Deviruchi , this phase either t5 or hydross chest
t5 is straight upgrade to t4
no?
t5 should be free
hydross chest too
not really
pretty sure gloves + shoulders is just better for 2pc
2 gem sockets vs 13sp and 10 hit
yea hit
uhh what 1% crit?
https://i.nuuls.com/B5ito.png
what 1% crit?
is it somekind of hidden stat or something?
what are you on about
why are you saying soul-eater has 1% crit compared to t4 gloves
nah'
in full bis shadow is pretty much equal
depending on isb uptime ofc
and mages arent going fire anytime soon
not really
in this phase its around 150 difference
shadow scales better tho
shadow doesnt need to cast immolate
etc
i heard ur getting first skull odaal
first sliver too?
oh no no no
marco bros
oh no no no no
who will you get to cast coe/cor in raids
i dont think even cuck like marco would stay after that
what do you mean
priests always cast it
even if it kills them
thats why you have soulstone rotation on them
dont worry marco
nota is probably recruiting locks
why do you even care about wboss loot
literally useless
you nerds wasted like 500h to get useless loot
unlucky
infernal will be lvl 50
will do literally nothing
80% of base mana +2 sec cast
seed will do more dps probably
yes
inferno has 6.5k hp, hits for like 200 and does 35 dmg fire aura
could be worth it as a prepop in hyjal
but probably will die pretty fast
!mgi
30 int
yea
not really
30 int is a lot of mana
whole point of bowiz is getting off extra seeds
what helps you get off extra seeds? mana
just go 30 int
if you shill for soulfrost might aswell use fang when seeding
its not a big deal
and idk if bowiz is even worth it when not aoe capped
could be decent if you perfect smuggling with taps
do i buy bowiz for 2k?
:peepohigh:
any feelscrafters with bowiz here?
is it worth it
and this is feelscraft?
:peepohigh:
so its not a feelscraft
guess i buy it so i can feelscraft
it is
like +300g
t5 chest is very good too
well that depends
its week 9
every hunter / mage should have t5 chest already
elven arent trash?
i thought mages wanted 4pc t5
even as fire
are you sure?
t5 stats are pretty good
70sp is pretty good too
has to be decent uptime even on fire
3%
so 164 hit if they dont have ele
having 0 hit talents what makes us good
hit talents are wasted later on
better to not have any
its orange
yellow/red
dont use crit oranges unless you want socket bonuses
9sp is better
leader of the pack isnt reason you bring a feral
they are just best tanks right now
restokin is a meme
only used because people still cope fury stack
healshoulders + trinket vashj
so when is progress running
@Mcartoscelli did you test if it buffs other locks corruption?
can you test it?
yea but can you test it?
you cant test it right now?
how is prism dogshit
reduces shitload of threat on crits
could easily save ur life
progress failed 2 tainteds right
and that asspull wasted like 20-30s alone
ofc the one lock switching to fire was doing 200 more dps
arc fire had 0 PI/innervate
im pretty sure they were just testing arc/fire and fire locks
@Itsmarco time to tell odaal go arc/fire
xelrog pretty sure we can
sure if you were a warlock had life tap
then haste CD would always be good
but arcane doesnt have infinite mana
most locks had only one weapon with soulfrost probably
was a test if i had to guess
next week they go 40sp like chads or get pvp dagger on everyone
he should have been fire on morogrim
but griefing
one lock does literally nothing on ISB uptime when you have 8
they were just testing
probably get pvp dagger or 40sp on everyone next week
so better player played better spec?
who is suprised
how is it worse spec?
arc/fire did more raid dps
and most locks werent even fire
hellfire meta? :pepebrain:
priest can only get 2/3 misery and PI
i think
they had locks being shadow too
with imp scorch in raid
fixing that alone saves a lot of time
well if they had switched to fire on morogrim
and stayed fire after that
could have won
yes innervate and PI is dps loss
maybe arc/fire had more mana to do mana gems
:pepebrain:
nah
soulshatter is lost global
most locks suck
idk if its a discussion even
fire is more dps
mages want to grief the raid
did mages forget mana is a thing?
did they really sim infinite mana?
@Itsmarco my guild does the same
literally told them its griefing and less raid dps
running 2 arc/frost mages
arc/frost+arc/fire
Warlock should never use jade pendant. It has no CD
Its not parse, its raid dps whole point of using necks
Its not parsing, its minmaxing dps
Why even use necks if you dont want to minmax dps
Faster smoother runs
Warlocks already have to curse
Pendant is too much
Are you progress gamer?
Yea
Yonka
Losing to everyone
They all had soulfrost enchants
Probably just tested it and get glad weapon or 40sp next week
Flk is worth it
Fire is very big for giants
Its still like 5m hp to dps down
Fire is very big
And FLK after that
Well 2nd arc frost lost shitload
And he even had innervates
He scorched anyway
For sappers and shit
Why wouldnt he
Scorch isnt a bad spell
So fel dom?
You could just double pull murlocs anyway
Depends on ISB uptime and sre you dooming
Leo is very caster unfriendly
Could have made it easily with firelocks tho
Warriors have full uptime and get free rage
Literally the only warrior friendly fight
In warrior stack vashj probably
time to theorycraft fire affli :pepebrain:
not even grabbing malediction
only reason to go affli
zephans america :peepohigh:
can blizz just fucking fix bugs
priest is never getting t6 before EVERY LOCK
even prot pala isnt always getting it before locks
giving class loot because you have one of them in raid doesnt make sense
its way bigger raid dps upgrade for locks
pretty sure gruul locks were fire
mag was better for pets
locks will be #1 dps next phase
glaive fury might get close
imagine playing wotlk unironically
progress locks didnt even cast incinerate with imp scorch
that alone saves them minute
and?
goesting had worse gear
0 PI / innervate
if goestin had some support could have been #1
you
gremmer do you mean personal dps?
or raid dps?
because goesting had literal 0 support
and lost by 50 dps
and worse gear
icy veins does literally nothing
if you have mana problems
they were swapping shaman around
not mages i think
you could have switch on every boss
and lose basically nothing
with fel doms
lurker hydross both fire for free
you fel dom sac succubus after that
stay shadow until last leotheras pack
switch
idk if fel dom will be up after leo
after leo is the only part where casting succubus for 5s kinda hurts
everything else is cool
they were oom and couldnt create runes ofc
because of IV
:pepebrain:
skycrab did you redpill them about arc/fire yet
how do i check how much fire dmg was dealt to scorched mobs
yes the secret arc/fire and firelock meta
:peepohigh:
never heard before
thats pretty big
that alone almost makes arc/fire more raid dps
why wouldnt melees use flame caps
free dmg
they use scrolls
not on most bosses
just go farm whippers :peepohigh:
infinite free healthstones
wdym
if you get hit by whirlwind and dont healthstone
ur 100% dead
yes as a lock
healers too busy probably healing melees or something
its the worst one
probably stop using it next phase
those are bis whole game
https://i.nuuls.com/uvZxE.png
:peepohigh:
you use t5 legs for normal gear
and spellstrike with 3x crit gems for seeding
you should make video about fire lock
:peepohigh:
and seed bugs
dogshit company
how is blizzard even okay with the fact that warlocks are doing about 10% less dps because of a bug
well arc/fire seems to be pretty good spec
(like i said before)
and other warlocks seeds dont pop other warlocks seeds
:peepohigh:
thats a big one
forces you to run mage pretty much always
yea
forced to run mages because of a bug
there was a good screenshot of dr boom
seed doing about 10% too low dmg because of the bug
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/823471727081422849/899656339427590214/unknown.png
10 mobs
seed hitting 1357
so 12213 dmg
missing 10%
10 mobs
9 bots+dr boom
its counting dr boom on aoe cap
so missing about 10% dmg
little MD sapper on mage
well set bonus is around 900 sp worth
so very big when not aoe capped
try it out
maybe
probably not
quag+sextant
especially when under aoe cap
im using shiffar+quag because i dont have sextant yet
has anyone tested out 4pc t5 yet?
surely someone has gotten it already
so it doesnt buff other locks corruption/immolate?
its confirmed?
interesting we got the ultra shit version then
wtf was blizzard thinking with t5 set bonus
what the actual fuck
why nerf it back then
t4 2p is pretty good tbh
ele t4 is sick
mage t5 is just insane
but lock t6 is insane too
https://i.nuuls.com/4Y5mf.png
bro
i wish i was male orc
mages already get sick trinket for free
next phase
it has to be good if skull is good
mages dont use motc?
well based on my feelscraft crit is very good on shadow locks
but sp & haste better
any 10k shadow bolters in chat?
am i really the only one
@Healspls my shadow bolt is bigger
:peepohigh:
sextant on shadow
:yikes:
double active feels dogshit
you need to press F twice
instead of once per 2 mins
quag is bis
wtf
:peepohigh:
quag always procs
vestments overrated
i got t5 chest
its good enough
https://i.nuuls.com/2pP4P.png
good enough for me
you wouldnt even get full value of double on-use here
nah
you get only 3 uses
if you pop instantly
https://i.nuuls.com/ddihj.png
what the fuck is this
2 misses
im getting griefed by blizzard
progress used pala tank
windforce used a lot of hit gear
int isnt that good
could be very good tho depending on fight length
but usually you have to tap even if you went full int gear
it would be worse
int would be only good if you end up fight with 0 mana and wouldnt have to tap at all
how often that would happen?
96 is like 1.90 seeds
why when fight could end up before you get that extra 1 seed
or it would be too long that makes you tap
at both points crit would be better
and if you ever need to cast shadow bolts in seed set you really dont want 8 int gems
they had 2 druids dude
45 min run
how do mages have time to cast evocation?
if locks cant switch sacs?
you need atleast one warrior
what else would you bring to phys grp
ret maybe?
3rd blessing
you need one feral group
12x locks is max you can run right now
and thats with 0-1 mages
next phase you can just skip phys grp
have pala tanks
wdym
progress lost 40s on asspull
2 tainteds
locks were shadow with imp scorch
all of those were around 1 min time loss
most of their locks had soulfrost enchant
idk if they even had the correct spec
or if they were catabolting
you snapshot hellfire with quags and bowiz
mages got busted mana regen because of 2.4 too
they were dogshit before that
Leveling mage oh no no no
If they want to stop bleeding they should just release t6
Blizz keeps making shit decisions
Actually 100% retarded decisions
Unlucky, maybe they should aim to be 10/10 then
And not wait for nerfs
And what about swp? Will be nerfed like week 2 because its too hard
casting shadow bolt instantly after curse is a bit monka
even with MD
easily can crit 7k
wdym 4s ?
if tank misses shit
you could pull
you can always remove doom
if its about to pop when switching
did anyone even talk about arc/fire in mage discord
pretty sure they are griefing
:Pepeclown:
fire lock isnt that good in next tier tho
shadow beats it with high ISB uptime
atleast on hildi sim
even at 75% isb uptime
which is very realistic
its 20 dps difference
in full bis ofc
on leo packs you stand in melee
lurker packs too kinda near melee
i did like 6 naxx resets
7/8 t3, motc,2x sapph enchants and soulseeker
they should have removed attunement
not nerf content
ruins speedruns
8/10 guilds wont even see illidan
BT is too long
8/10 guilds wont kill a single swp boss
so blizz will nerf them
problem is
blizz will nerf all the content after 2 months now
because dog players cant clear everything and unsub
naxx wasnt nerfed
blizzard should just push out T6
if they are worrieda bout people quitting
theres only 3 SWP t6 pieces
you use shoulders or helmet from bt/hyjal gear
in most cases shoulders
no wbuffS?
no
tanks need atleast t2.5 or t2
and loatheb + sapph will be very very very very hard
??? pretty sure sp gems are better
seed sapper the wave
hope you dont die
this is Zephans america :peepohigh:
at what number of warlocks does isb uptime start to lower? :pepebrain:
you could want nether protection for week 1 mother
but emberstorm probably better
because of prismatic shield
are we sure paladin cant do that?
dont take imp searing pain
its trash
1 point in immolate btter
VR is fire fight
wdym
progress already prove arc/fire is bis
well you can go check their logs
if we do nerfs based on original timeline
we should release content same way
so create a time machine and add t4 t5 and hyjal day 1
they probably dont do it after vanilla som flops super hard
SoM tbc would be actually good
bur we are never going to get it
unlucky
jpaint assumes people play shadow
:peepohigh:
tide is turning
nah
going max sp AND critting is the most fun
if you crit, all crit rating you stacked
is useless
well even then sp is better stat
because if you dont crit, all crit rating you geared for is wasted
same thing with hit really
so stack SP & haste kids
:peepohigh:
T4 gloves arent bad
Best piece to get 2pc t4
Well if its best its best
Most minmaxers arent tailoring anymore
Next phase you can just use offpiece legs
Dont have to go tailoring
You go engi for bombs & rocket boots, not the helm
You do actually, spellfire gloves if tailoring
If you arent speedrunning no reason to go engi
Throwing nade every 1 min is 180g / h
If you arent speedrunning why bother
Toyota Corolla is based
You will always be on coe duty too
Well its 150-200 globals lost per raid
what
you always take conflag if you take 5/5 immo
best finisher
if immolate is up
wdym
bro
immo tick is what 300?
conflag is 2-4k
wtf
soul leech almost always overheals
literally worst talent you can take
well nether protection could be worse if ur tanking
looks like hes spamming 2 buttons
real locks just press shadow bolt
pretty sure tailoring shoulders arent that good for ST
t6 shoulders are insane actually
idk about that
legs probably better offpiece
bro just compare tailoring shoulders and t6
based on my feelscraft, channeled elements has to be best offpiece
after vestments
wait its even better than vestments?
surely moonkins/eles have some other offpiece they can use?
:peepohigh:
you dont let other people dps p2
seed whole p2 alone
ur #1
well u guys made people play DN
:peepohigh:
actual griefers
10s imp
:pepebrain:
succubus is the biggest joke ingame
not even imp survives anything
realistically? maybe next year maybe before chrismas. when they should release it? about a month ago
well next phase shadow is realistically better
but right now fire is better
well atleast one mage should be arc/fire even now
and fights will be longer next phase
so really should be arc/fire
America
:peepohigh:
well not destro potion
not that you should use destro potion tbh in most cases
kinda wanted to roll belf because looks cool in t6
but then i remembered skull exists and you really want blood fury
you only do it for seeding
and idk if its worth it really
what is this laty comp
i saw vestments week 1
not a single one after thajt
:peepohigh:
oh no no no
he didnt dodge vestments
viscidus is literally free loot
probably can be done with 5
!mgi
Yeah that fat 1.5k sp crit
Why
Its same threat
Catabolt is a meme, speedruns should have arc/fire anyway
Arc/fire fits in 12 lock comp
Spirit actually 0 value on lock
Bro sald comp is actual grief
Pala does probably more tps in FR gear
maitoz wanted to be the only scarab lord in guild
thats why they didnt help
and they had to get wbuffs for world #1300 AQ clear too
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=29305/band-of-the-eternal-sage#comments

comments seem to say ICD is 45s but tooltip says its 1 min?
any idea which one it will be in classic?
ring should be bis with 45s ICD right?
atleast on ST
does the sim have correct ICD?
well based on wowhead comments its 45s
well actually one comment says its 1 min ICD
so idk
using destro pot with lust means you need to tap
:peepohigh:
weapons is 6 targets right
i dont think ur aoe capped
so trinket isnt that bad to use there
you need one mech HC gem next phase too
if taking ZD
its not
toc is insane
259 sp alone beats 229sp + 21 spell haste
on sim blade of twisted visions is about 30-40 dps lower
and thats with hit being 0 value
well on sim its 30-40 dps
https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/87027-zhardoom-greatstaff-of-the-devourer.jpg
wdym fem human is best gear
especially with t6 helm
what
fem human warlock gear is literally bis
female belf is maybe close
time to go lvl my belf lock
:peepohigh:
bro im not gay
:peepohigh:
ur literally sick
female belf = female human = male orc >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> other races >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> UD male
i wish i went male orc
:peepohigh:
how many orange gems are you using?
guldan was male orc
male orc is bis
no he was a warlock
:peepohigh:
https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/604565-guldan.jpg
does this look like a shaman
https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/81771-guldan.jpg
Gul'dan the Warlock, Master of the Inner Circle of the Shadow Council and Destroyer of Dreams, was the most powerful warlock in the Horde - indeed, the most powerful non-Eredar warlock ever to exist. He is known for describing himself as "darkness incarnate" and "the Destroyer of Dreams." The latter title is believed to be a reference to his triumph over the Conjurers of Azeroth, known as "Dwellers in Dream."
guldan was fire lock
fire?
no way ur getting 2450 on shadow
100% isb uptime or what
im getting around 2330 in t5 bis
ofc you can on hildi sim
leech is least useless
point you can get
:pepebrain:
could hellfire be good on 3 mob cleave
with imp sac
people dont even use fire locks
in 8 warlock comp
????
and call themself speedrunners
:pepebrain:
rocket boots into melee and hellfire
we are creating a new meta here
??? hellfire is sick
just need haste snapshot
you can also use ZG neck
for bigger aoe on hellfire
marco bro
haste snapshot hellfire is OP
obviously we are discussing morogrim here
RoF is weak
you get less value from snapshotting
rocket boots -> sapper -> hellfire
sick combo
random drill teleport to BRD is best
well you should try to hit hitcap aslong you dont go over it
but its not end of the world if ur 4 rating under the cap
t5 chest is good enough
try to dodge vestments so you get channeled elements in next phase
yes the play is to dodge vestments so you get channeled elements legs
https://i.nuuls.com/gGK11.png
i think belf is my new main
belf is pretty good too
free 10sp
giving it to nonwarlocks basically implodes your guild
it should be warlock only item
:peepohigh:
and orange
does hildi sim automatically add blood fury if i choose orc
or do i need to tick it on somewhere?
make it orange too
2.1.2
it was fixed in later patches
do you have imp scorch?
well if you have immolate talent
you should use it most of the time
why arent they casting incinerate
if they have fire mage
mages getting too cocky
didnt they see what happened to hunters
Fury stacker bros
What went wrong
Cthun ring is insane
Im still using it
Depends, do you use reds or orange gems
HKM is pretty good if gemming oranges
I tested out catabolt but idk
Its pretty much the same
Just dodge vestments and yoink channeled elements
Wait sb actually kicked their only decent lock?
Join nota
They have to start recruiting locks
Vestments isnt bis next phase
Its not, channeled elements is best offpiece
Sure when i get home
Blue gems?
We might get haste gems too
Probably will
Cba to play with foreigners
Already in the best finnish guild
Buying glaives is pure cope, most people will never see 2 drop
Yea we should have t6 out already
Tf dropped week 1
Hopefully we get t6 in december
Hyjal will be kino
Seeds seeds seeds, mages decursing
Peak TBC
You want to snapshot hellfire with lust
Haste gems are sick because it scales seed
For ST its whatever
4th t6 piece adds shitload
Swp is like 1k boost
Bt+hyjal 600 dps
It is in full bis
But not many are going to get that
Haste isnt big on st vs 12sp gems but on aoe its big
Nah you tap faster too
With haste
It is because of seed
You always gem haste
Haste bis
we discussed this earlier
bags dont work sameway and wont give epic gems most likely
have you thought about getting prism for healers?
would be good maybe
i dont think fetish is good for healers
probably should get prism
imagine not having 2 sapph enchants
for T4 & T6
wait improved fel armor, does it buff incoming healing too?
so its actually 26% inc healing?
https://i.nuuls.com/pIX_l.png
@Xelrog
i have 6 sp 6 stam in bank
probably should use it somewhere
i have one in belt of blasting
probably gonna put 2nd in t4 shoulders
gonna put 12sp + 2x 9sp gems on vestments
:peepohigh:
no way
even as shadow
more sp more 10k crits
well if you care about that small raid dps upgrades you should be fire anyway
okay maybe im going 2x oranges+blue on vestments
and 12sp on t5 legs
:peepohigh:
now only need to get vestments
:peepohigh:
i saw vestments week 1
been #1 on them since then
@jpaint what about +10 spell crit gem
is that better than 4crit 5sp too
what the fuck
is mage the gm?
thats hard grief
i doubt that guild is 10/10
find a new one
udc oh no no no
https://i.nuuls.com/swh4G.png
tbc reroller here
udc was dogshit in vanilla for warlocks
and its even worse in tbc
blessed wizard oil should DQ your swp logs
:peepohigh:
its only fair
frozen rune
:pepebrain:
gamers
you will eat the bugs
and you will be happy
also knockback in p1
lowers corruption value even more
well you shouldnt but most people will get pushback
we dont know
gear would be same
you would gem a bit differently
leggings of channeled elements would be way better than vestments i think
you gem haste everywhere
because it actually scales your seed
and is literally the same as sp on ST
haste also makes you tap faster
but sp gives more mana from taps
doesnt matter really
just gem haste
put 2 blues somewhere where it gets you bonuses
you will be getting shitload of 10k crits next phase
4pc t6 is insane
you will literally replace everything but 2 pieces next phase
And if you dont have vestments you only keep 1 item
why would you reroll from best scaling class
to worse scaling class?
glaives arent even swp bis
did i say worst?
i said worse
warriors are way overhyped, in swp warlocks get actually insane
and if we ever have any kind of aggro problems
fury will be doing around twice as much threat compared to warlocks
warriors have been near the top
and actually peak now compared to warlocks
short fights favors warriors
badge is insane
etc etc
crafted weapon is insane
meanwhile warlocks got literally 0 upgrades this phase
and in most cases lost dps because of no imp scorch meta
if you think every warrior will have glaives
idk what to tell you
short fights just favor warriors pretty hard
especially if they have chickens
we wont have many short fights in future
??? furies are in melee
dont have threat drop
more like 0.60
and we arent in melee
idk swp mobs will hit pretty hard
but hard to say if we will have threat problems
i said furys peak now compared to warlocks
this is literally the worst tier for warlocks
and still is the meta class
glaive fury might be able to compete next phase with warlocks
but idk
dragging is kinda meh
you can just pull the mob into next pack
and continue aoeing
you dont actually have to kill it while running
yes?
did ur guild figure out warlock stacking is the play yet?
@Stabile well warlock seed bug wasnt exactly known at that point
and every mage you take eats one spriest group spot
which could be given to a healer
2 prot paladins isnt bad at all in SSC
but idk if you want to run that in TK
idk if they have sunders assigned
but cor does jackshit if mob doesnt have sunders
pretty sure they are giving up on tbc
going som
dodge vestments
take channeled elements
playing wotlk :Pepeclown:
theres no way they arent doing race/faction change in wotlk
they would make INFINITE MONEY
or just get t5 legs
hyjal too i think
atleast mace drops in both
imagine being in dkp guild
spriest/moonkin/ele has beens saving dkp from day 1 for skull
illidan drops some bow
(hopefully we will never see it)
giving spriest skull literally kills the guild
not really
you cant give skull to anyone but locks
look at the item
wdym 3rd one is hard to use?
press more arcane blast
wait it is?
fucking griefer mages
on aoe its way better for locks
dont see them dropping much below that
but maybe
crit is useless if you crit or you dont crit
:peepohigh:
boomie is using green jc neck
idk
moonkin aura is pretty big with shadow locks
actually no
IFF is a meme
and aura is the real value
yea illidan is real melee friendly :Pepeclown:
archimonde too
sarcasm
they literally can not dps him in demon phase
but melee copers think they can kill him before that
so it wont be a problem
:Pepeclown:
if you are trying to minmax raid dps, raid will just have warlocks
and their support classes
most people dont do that
i had 5/5 oblivion day 4 of tbc
fucking blizzard
fixing som shit every day
and wont fix gamebreaking seed bug
even next phase idk if it will be worth it
losing a lot of shadow bolt dmg
will depend on packs
and if we have haste gems next phase
oblivion wont be worth it unless you gem haste in them too
expensive as in one gem will be like 5k
not a single raiding guild will be selling them
we arent getting quick dawnstones in anycase right?
its swp thing
my guess is we are getting epic haste gems
we had CSD p1
yeah but you get haste gem from hyjal rep
hunters dont just get literal +30% dmg when they get lusted
only lock does that really
better to not have CDs
orc always has CD :peepohigh:
why are male belfs even allowed
:peepohigh:
nah orcs arent drug addicts anymore
diaper gnomes atleast
every day we stray further away from god
:peepohigh:
jaina is the reason arthas was corrupted
its all her fault
i wonder...
what incel culture?
sylvanas has been mary sue for last 10 years now
because one soy writer loves her
vanilla sylvanas is hotter
https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/84754-lady-sylvanas-windrunner-old-model.jpg
ill probably start using prism always when seeding
dying is massive dps loss
in my last run actually lost 300k because of a death
yea
sextant is better shiffars
Can you increase nameplate range in som?
haste is sick for seeding
4th warlock
because moonkin is actual dead raidspot if he doesnt buff 3 locks+ele
@Lpebony do you want to spend shitload of gold so boss dies 0.1s faster?
just remember ABC - Always Be Casting
catabolt on pull is pretty monka
you pray you dont get too many crits
even with hunters
two on-use is just too hard to use
:peepohigh:
compared to one
doesnt matter really
only haste makes flame cap better
sp trinkets literally dont matter
you are using mana pot in most fights
in most fights yeah
where you get lusted
maybe outside lust
but in lust you go oom
PI is better on warlocks
because it only reduces AB base mana cost
6 healers actually makes game harder
do people really pay for t5 loot?
when literally everyone is going to replace everything next phase
swipers could just afk until next phase
and then buy all the gear
anyone kill vashj with 4 buffs yet
??
prism doesnt suck
it saves your life
usually you die if seed happens to crit multiple times on same mob
prism basically removes that chance
any speedruns tonight?
how do they do it
fury stack is supposed to be meta
who else failed on hydross
what comp were they running
dogshit hunter stack again?
why dont they just run 8 locks and scout fire vulnerability giants
dodging vestments is 140 IQ
you will have prio on channeled elements
if prot pala didnt have magus blade
it was kinda smart thing to do
we gave first fang to prot pala because he didnt have magus blade
you can curse
no problem
how do we get seed fixed
:peepohigh:
its literally gamebreaking bug
Yea dont cor then
Them
So people can fear / coil
Vashj is free loot, actually killed it with 4 buffs
40 attempts
Nice
Vashj is a dps check
Prot palas actually blessing spam?
Is that why people use pala mt in lock stack
Must do insane threat
EQ thats kino
will we use any honor gear in p3 p4 p5 ?
how much honor is that
actually looks like haste neck was added in 2.4 ?
so might not get it idk
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=35319/vindicators-pendant-of-subjugation#comments
250-300 SR in green gear means you will never kill the boss
you gotta zug it down with like 150 buffed
stack locks for nether protection and easier healing etc
@gremmer🐢 300 even buffed sounds super rough
if you get mana drain beam its a wipe
yea people will nuke it down
its 3.9m hp
biggest question is what prismatic shield are we getting
and how does it work
rely on what?
you only spec nether prot for week 1 progression anyway
2 min duration
you only need it for fatal attraction ( if you need it at all)
well ur missing a mana pot then
rocket boots will be insane too
i think poopsockers will use them
or just using mana pots
my guess is people will be using 1-2 pieces
and neck
+ cloak
https://i.nuuls.com/_Lyca.png
any gamers?
:pepebrain:
dont have vestments
or hydross robe (t5 is better anyway)
nah t5 has to be better
t5 robe is actually insane
well i dont have any problems going to 164 hit
but my trash set has 155 hit
switch veiled to crit/sp gems
:Pepetear1:
yeah
crit is a bad stat
hit too
only stack sp/haste
well depends
is progress running today
@Itsmarco sure fully wbuffed
when
prism is actually insane
you put it on when seeding and dont die
well with salve prism reduces 700 threat from crits
wdym
2300-700
1000 base
reduced by threat reductions
so 700 on seed crits
and usually if you pull aggro its because you happen to crit multiple times on same mob
trinket queue
:peepohigh:
stop it
switch them manually
https://i.nuuls.com/T9qy2.png
im reading wowhead comments
MH trash isnt AE friendly?
well you can go check world first mother kill
literal 11 min fight
3.9m hp
quags always on lock
better & easier to play
bro
literally every top log is using quags+pipe/icon
just use quags
wbuffed?
or no buffs
and how many good guilds actually ran more than 3 locks?
double on-use is harder to play
in most cases quags would do more dps
lock parsing is all about crit rng
you cant do any cheese like on furies
you just need +60% crit chance and multiple lusts
well lock also has most competition
pretty sure nota is going to lock stack soon
might be fun but in the end theres only one optimal comp
fury stack might work in TK but idk
wdym
im on ptr rn
leveling
fury ofc
rogues need sunders & battle shouts
vashj is actually free loot
killed it with 4 buffs yesterday
vashj drops leather shoulders/plate gloves/plate chest
:peepohigh:
well if they dont want to beat progress
sure they can stay fury comp
scouting fire vulnerability giants and having 8 fire locks
would make room so fast
just get oblivion set
all you need
oblivion legs are shit tho
int might do something
or it might do nothing
putting epic crit/sp gem on blasting is the play
mages dont want PI
unlucky
PI only reduces AB base mana cost
its way better on locks
hmmm
some mage was saying it only reduces base
but shouldnt have PI anyway
can you trust mages tho?
could be fake
they wont even run arc/fire
even though its more raid dps
its insane trinket
actual omega bis on fire
sextant proc is insane
crusader trinket boosts taps right? motc doesnt
but anyway motc is just easier to use
when is progress running
@ThomasE are you in a speedrunning guild?
rocket boots is the only reason to go engi really
tailoring shoulders will be nice next phase for seeding
belt pattern?
u guys havent seen any yet?
we have seen like 5-6
??
gamers crafted chicken and then switched to goblin
(like i did)
its not
demo doesnt have ruin
you cant complain about healing mace
cheesing p2 or being fire probably
more dps you have in p2/p3 worse you will perform
how long do you afk in p2 / p3 ?
we afk like 50s p2 and 10-15s p3
yeah
will be 2-3 min afk in total probably
post nerf
idk
no debuffs on capernian
still missing misery+shadow weaving
or imp scorch if fire
no dagger debuff on capernian in most guilds
its doable tho
enha stocks going down hard
they just floor pov
doesnt affect parses at all tho
you just afk longer
not really no
arc/fire is very strong
or fix seed bug(s)
any mage experts here
do i take master of elements or elemental precision as arc/fire ?
@Ryusei do i use max rank scorch / fireball?
as a filler
yea but max rank? or downranked
down have spriest or resto so will have a lot of mana problems
@Ryusei so i dont cast fireball at all?
just 5x scorch as filler?
ofc you prio set bonus to someone
skull is lock item anyway
just pray you get drops
@Ryusei so do i go master of elements or elemental precision, will have ele shaman so master of elements maybe better?
a lot of incinerates
should have went fire in vashj atleast
could have been a kill
their ele shaman died twice
yea was like 2 mins ahead
and that was with like 20 deaths
pretty much same comp as last weeek
had more firelocks this week on first 2 bosses
didnt switch on vashj / morogrim for some reason
any gamers with eternal darkness here? :peepohigh:
u got blade?
:peepohigh:
do i need to go farm it :peepohigh:
no public logs i think
surely someone has it
:peepohigh:
fug
time to hit mara
it was tested
doesnt work
drop rate is pretty common
everyone go farm it
:peepohigh:
oh im going
its common drop now
its barely worth it on 3 targets
with seed set its probably worth it almost
you want to nuke skull / cross on FLK
pet also resets aggro afaik
so very risk
:peepohigh:
2sp
https://i.nuuls.com/YoXLl.png
:peepohigh:
it was tested out earlier
and didnt work back then
very big
bis for seeding whole game
mana + dmg
its 10% proc
but you would get a lot of mana back
on top of a dmg
that alone would make it bis probably
warlocks dont have infinite mana
twitch chat comment
:peepohigh:
maybe it works
:Pepeclown:
i saw it drop like twice
when i was farming mara on my warrior
so doesnt work?
not getting a proc in 17 hits could be just unlucky
but most likely doesnt work
i wonder how it worked in original tbc
:peepohigh:
is blizz fucking us again
blizz probably fucking warlocks again
:peepohigh:
bowiz is dog :peepohigh:
T5 legs is best socket for 12 sp
Are you fire? @King Hayek
2.6k VR actually requires like 70% crit on shadow
Male orc is so cool
Smuggling weapon switches feels like shit
Its on-use
Not proc
Could fg demo be good
VST + 2pc t5 and he wont die probably
Im pretty sure spriests dont want ZD
They end up losing a lot of sp
Why would anyone ask lock to not tap
does it actually do something on leo
well ogre suit is pretty based
but if it makes your model bigger actual grief
based speedrun expert drast
keep waiting
laty is going F R E S H
yeah kicked their only decent lock
in lock expansion
who?
imagine not using pala tank
:peepohigh:
actual griefing
you didnt get kicked?
based
yea basically everyone expect mages and maybe moonkins replace literally everything
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/htN19dttL27kPktc8uPfG3
p5 bis
:KEKL
mages thinking they are getting skull
its 30 dps if we assume hit is 0 value ( its not )
150-210
but warlock uses the hit
so its way better
no you wont be
you use hit in swp too
its a warlock item
even most cucked warlocks wont stay in a guild if they dont get skull
it is realistic
only other class who really uses haste rings is mage
ofc you prio 1 haste ring to every lock first
hit is literally dead stat on skull on mages
120s sim
thats some mage tier copium
90% performing destro ofc
that 90% lock will be outdpsing 99% mage in next phase too
yeah people run 8 locks
1-3 mages
you tell me which one is better
dont expect those locks to stay in guild if u take skull over them
double lust + high crit + doom
is high 99
miss any of those and ur not getting high 99
fury is like 0 rng
all about how much guild boosts you
casters in wotlk
oh no no
just play fury / dk
is KT casting bug in transmission back?
yea
just wiped to it
on pull / after murloc waves
i use pipe/eye
and you use mana pot in that fight
stuck?
cant do solo farm first week if going for fast clear
:pepehands:
well BT farm drops omega bis items
gems
people will do it a lot
custom name on details
:peepohigh:
no way
:peepohigh:
no way
feelscraft > sim
im looking at the pieces
theres no way mag gloves beat SS legs
with 3x crit gems
int might be decent (in some fights)
and in other fights its useless
you always have time to tap
Well on weapon you lose sp
Dots dont benefit from haste
??
they dont want to do more dps?
yea its probably pretty good on fire
t6 and channeled elements
is bis
just dodge vestments
dont use shoulders wtf
take channeled elements legs
channeled elements are bis
vestments is 2nd bis
nah
we might get them next phase
requires 'simple grinder'
https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=47056/quick-lionseye
id say its pretty likely we are geting haste gems
but blizz hates locks so idk
and CSD was added in BT patch
but we got it day 1
@Blow mage plays arcane doesnt take any loot
sure they can take it
but they shouldnt expect locks to stay in guild after that
if nonlock got skull before me id quit
any guild
yap thats the best part
arcane mages dont want any haste gear
https://i.nuuls.com/uEOV4.png
mage discord is great content
hunters :Pepeclown:
moonkins want t6
mace
locks pump with lust
other classes not so much
idk if fury gets that much from haste dude
even with 5x chickens they dont beat other classes
it is hard for sure
@Madarb wrong
its 20 dps
well actually 30 dps
its 30 dps
when i simmed it
but that was full bis
toc+OH is 2 drops also
might never see the other piece
and on aoe ZD is way better
not even close
nah
people will kill illidan before archimonde
yeah if ur taking ZD, dont think ur getting swp oh/weapon
mages getting way too cocky
almost like hunters last phase
naxx 25 immortal
will be done week 1
wotlk is just doa expansion
wotlk will be literally super easy
theres literally no point in doing splits
no one is going to bother with wotlk speedrunning
game will be too different
killing trash is like 75% of speedrunning
and that will be basically removed in wotlk
dont see it being very popular
well game basically peaked when raids had a lot of trash
vanilla tbc
id say vanilla & tbc had best balance
just because every class does almost same amount of dmg doesnt mean its balanced
if spriest did same dps as warlock, no one would bring warlocks
and every raid member would have infinite mana
best tank
good healer
should druid have 4 good specs?
beating pure dps/healer/tank classes ?
no thats where you are wrong
balance doesnt mean every spec / class does same amount of dmg
and brings same amount of utility
spriests havent considered anything
they just want ZD
even though it loses them sp
giving warlock ZD so isb has higher uptime
is probably more dps for spriest too
depends
do they always mind blast / death on CD ?
and what about trash dps
where priest just multidots
surely stacking sp is better ?
not really
sp better
i heard upgrading from mindblade to ZD is 30 dps upgrade on spriests
:peepohigh:
if ZD is actually 30 dps upgrade from mindblade + badge OH
mace has to be better actually
and pvp weapon omega bis
t5 legs is bis
like haste isnt even that good on locks
why would spriest want it
its literally same as sp on ST
locks
https://i.nuuls.com/RBlRf.png
haste gems vs 12 gems is like 10 dps difference
p3 gear
(ON ST)
on aoe haste is omega bis
this haste obsession with spriests
i dont understand
is there some math behind it?
why does spriest need to hit this haste breakpoint
and not just stack more sp?
personal sim?
:peepohigh:
are u guys serious?
@JordanF mace+OH ?
s3 dagger + OH ?
personal sim
:peepohigh:
and they want haste gear
no way
more haste you have better sp is
and vice versa
exponential scaling is main reason why we get 1k dps upgrade from swp gear
dont think about breakpoints
its a trap
oh?
OH atleast
and sword i think
and spriest is actual last for haste rings
after every lock has 2
never getting healer cloak
what theorycrafting
u guys obsess over haste breakpoint
instead of just gearing more sp
haste scales other classes way more
like if spriest takes healer haste cloak
ur losing 30 sp to gain 30 haste
idk if thats worth it
and about that breakpoint
dont you lose it all if fight has any movement at all?
or any knockback?
giving ZD to spriest is grief
when 4 members of raid want mace
or 3
and 5-10 want ZD/toc
it reduces like 200 from melee hits
prism is warlock only item
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=33334/fetish-of-the-primal-gods
haste badge OH
yea ZA
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=33585/achromic-trousers-of-the-naaru#comments
these are badge item atleast
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=33584/pantaloons-of-arcane-annihilation#comments
i think this is legs he meant
decent if you dont have chronicle
good for seeding probably
if you dont have ZD
maybe
but if you cast any shadow bolts with bowiz ur losing a lot of dps
looks like ZA patch
pantaloons looking pretty good
channeled elements+4pc is better
especially if we get haste gems
well its like 3-4 dps worse
and every caster wants channeled elements
so its better to take vestments as lock
but if you dont have vestments and guild decides to stop running vashj
you dont want mecha gems in next phase really
maybe one if using ZD setup
i havent seen anyone use multiple hc gems on any non boe item
i dont think that works
none, spec demo and go pump
6k?
8k feels low
when ur casting shadow bolts big number is the only fun thing
shadow lock is feels dogshit
vashj loot table is most tragic shit ever
atleast illidan cant drop shit loot
melee belt would be good
but healer gloves/plate chest/shoulders
dead items
mother has silence
but you can outrange it
mb good on pala tank
its confirmeD?
haste pvp neck was added in 2.4
Haste too right?
You never hit gcd cap from haste gear alone
Need lust/ procs / skull use
Well 36%
And isnt that like 1.2 gcd
Crit is useless stat if you crit and its useless stat if you dont crit
@Skycrab are saying lock doesnt compete with mages?
Mainly because of the seed bug
Mages dont even scorch atm, they are never getting fire gear
Same people who are shilling mages were shilling hunters last phase
Warlock is #1
Warlock stack is better
Thats why people run it
Warlocks also often are on curse duty
And most guilds arent even running imp scorch
No?
Fury actually needs feral
2 ferals isnt good
2 prot palas is way better
Prot pala is best pala spec
Retri/holy is dog
Paladin wont need t6 to aoe tank tbh
No?
If hes not maintanking, why would pala need t6
You dont go full sr for illidan
Epic offpieces will be enough
Skull will be atleast 1/6
Same as vestments
Illidan has 12 items
Its going to be 1/6, glaives are on different table
Is it confirmed? Vashj just has 2 6 item tables
Why wouldnt illidan be same
Not really?
Not a single classic end boss has worked thatcway
Mag and gruul dont have weapo only tables
Neither does prince
KT or vashj either
This 7/5 feels like pserver thing
Im pretty sure prince doesnt have weapon only loot table
Just gquit if mage takes skull over locks
Hunters?
Meta is to run 1 hunter
4-5 hunters isnt fine at all if you want to go fast
I didnt say every raid had perfect comps
Rogue isnt fine at all for vashj
Actually the worst class
Fury is good on ececute
Execute
Rogue is very mc unfriendly
Nah warriors cast shit like slam
Ass rogue
People run ass rogue
Isnt sub rogue better for imp ea in tbc
yeah dont think SE is resistable
well scorch secondary effect isnt resistable
u sure?
go reach
only 2pc
well on affli 4pc t4 is actually decent
reach is probably best talent you can grab in affli tree
extra range is insane
yeah raid does less dps
thats a good thing
arc/fire is actually so good
i have no idea why mages arent playing it
it literally is?
and even better
its literally +- 0 personal dps
and way better raid dps
while requiring less mana support
ofc you dont
mage discord is clueless
go check progress speedrun
@KilLogic well progress was  2-3 mins ahead WR
before vashj
top 4
it just shows how good arc/fire is
mages just want to grief the raid idk
so you are blind?
check top 4
if mages had infinite mana
sure thenb arc/frost would be better
but mages dont have infinite mana
why did you take KT cloak
way better on spriest/arcane mage/prot pala
even with leo sword
hkm should be better
if its so good why arent they using t2.5
that gives shitload of haste
well if they go haste stacking route
they are going to lose a lot of healing power
23 healing power?
oh yeah illidan cloak is 70 somethng healing power
do shamans know how does t2.5 set bonus work with haste
they lose what 200-300 healing power
and get a lot of haste
idk
whats 2nd best cloak for healers?
or best
(assuming illidan cloak is even bis for them)
haste cloak should be way better on aoe
@Crimble do you mean holy pala t6?
:Pepeclown:
holy palas are actually never getting t6
all the locks,priests,prot palas ahead
looks like ZD is 100 dps upgrade on aoe :Pepeclown:
i think we got it in the bag
haste cloak is 50 dps upgrade on aoe
tbh bros
skip sextant
give it to mages
you cut one more healer in next phase probably
and run 4
you mean swp?
it can be 2/3 healed most likely
cloak is 50 dps on aoe
its not theoretical
why do you care about vestments so much xelrog
its way overrated
dodge it and take channeled elements
sidegrade?
its omega bis if haste gems are in
id say they are in pretty likely
we got CSD in p1
arc/frost will be dogshit on progression
only hate mages tbh
people wont be selling epic gems
maybe some gdkps
fights will be longer in next phase too
that alone lowers arcanes dmg
very very heavily
warlocks got basically 0 upgrades in t5
same thing will happen to mages in next phase
meanwhile locks replace everything but 2 items
i actually did more ST dps like 6 weeks ago
because i was fire
speedruns guild seem to be switching to fire
arc/fire *
so probably meta switches soon
mages just sim 2 min fights
if they run oom they switch to 1 min fight
add few innervates
skull + motc is bis
eye is 2nd best
on trash skull/prism+eye
:peepohigh:
prism is best trinket
if you care about overall dps
??? prism is insane
:peepohigh:
not dying is biggest dps upgrade you can get
quag+prism
:peepohigh:
:peepohigh:
literally bis whole game
for seeding
progress doesnt run holy pala
holy pala is grief
and they are warlock heavy
so dont need that much healing
:pepebrain:
vestments isnt bis next phase
stop spreading fake news
channeled elements legs
always win by few dps
wait mages dont want them?
whats arcane might
oh no no no no
how long does it last
strat live mob?
hmmm
sounds hard
:Pepeclown:
if blizz fixes this
surely they will fix seed too
moro kinda has free taps
if ur doing pala heal strat
you want to tap so pala gets more threat
from heal
debuffs on mobs passes cap
isb, misery, shadow weaving
coe
shadow is dogshit
but mages want to grief the raid
even though arc/fire is superior spec
thats literally irrelevant on total dps
yes if we assume IV is always up
and we have infinite mana
yeah its real easy if we assume we got infinite mana
@Xelrog can you explain why goesting was only 50 dps behind arc/frost
while getting 0 innervates or PIs
and around 100 dps ahead the other frost mage
if arc/frost is so superior
doesnt matter
you just said arc/frost is way better
oh so if mage is good then arc/fire isnt that big loss?
oh so progress has mediocre mages now?
interesting
yea progress being ahead 2-3 mins WR run with fire locks
isnt a top run
:Pepeclown:
every guild should have imp scorch
!mgi
including seed?
12% from corruption sounds pretty high
on total
idk
when seed is like 50%
shadow bolt is other 50%
last raid 51% of my dmg was seed
as destro tho
sure if you dont care about raid dps
go ahead and ignore crit
if you run 8 locks, you should be fire anyway
np your welcome
mages grief raid by not bringing scorch
why should we use cor
@Louki they dont
i have personally tested it many times
they dont
i have been at KT 0 shards many times
and havent got shards out of anything
spriests eles moonkins taking skull in dkp guild
OH NO NO NO
oh so its not dkp?
its LC
illidan will be hard for most guilds
people will not be killing him before demon phase
rocket boots alone make the fight trivial
equip neck and rocket boots
boss is dead
if you cut casters, every beam will go to healers
give warlock tank like 2-3 epic piecees
hp is enough?
doesnt it hit like 10k
well mother is way overhyped
and warlocks will need the least SR anyway
if mother is pre pre pre nerf
melee teleport is insta wipe if melee heavy
well not really
more like stack warlocks
you know warlocks can cast both fire & shadow spells?
you use neck
rocket boots
and zerg it
well healers heal pounding
so beams wont be a problem
fatal attraction will be the problem
and rocket boots solves that
affli doesnt lose that much on total dps
bro
you actually eat burger king?
warlock uses hit even in swp
wrong
yea
ele 13% hit free
spriest 10%
im sure they will use the hit
arcane mage 10% hit
yeah they will use hit ofc
well you still bring atleast 5 shamans
why wouldnt you use sub enchant
bro
you switch cloak like 3 times whole tbc
just enchant subtelity
ele has 13% free hit
you cant pop CDs at 15s
or you wont have 2 uses
yea bro glaive comps will be so common
:Pepeclown:
glaives will drop so often
how many times have u guys seen ashes btw?
@CCwe and what was glaive droprate on pservers
it seems to be 4-5% on classic based on my research
i think reckful finished glaive set in cataclysm
so if people think stacking glaive furies is viable strat idk what to tell them
i dont think they are going to nerf chickens
blizz only hates locks
literally doesnt require any coordination
its 5% haste
4 min buff 20 min CD
would be nice if blizz fixed arcanite dragonling
or seed bug(s)
but its never going to happen
how often does illidan cast shadow blast btw+
its same tbh
mages :peepohigh:
why would dreamstate become meta
mages dont get to go fire in next phase
:peepohigh:
after griefing raid dps this phase
they stay arcane
mages have permanent uptime on IV anyway
and MQG
they dont need spell haste
dont do it
shadow is literally same dps in next phase
mages stay arcane
and dont take loot
this is what they wanted
https://i.nuuls.com/ifYd1.png
https://i.nuuls.com/P3R4Y.png
80% isb uptime
and we will see probably like 85%
but yeah
shadow will be better raid dps next phase for sure
on mother you will probably want fire/shadow locks
so arc mage goes arc/fire
shadow isnt better for raid dps now
:peepohigh:
warlocks can switch sac
arc/fire doesnt lose anything compared to arc/frost
you might want to check recent progress vod
@famoushorse speedrun is one long fight
?
yeah im a troll
not mages
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/CwpJDa2dLHT6bgWR#boss=-3&start=0&end=2736813&type=summary
see this log
arc/fire is literally dogshit right?
losing by 30 dps while bringing imp scorch and taking 0 innervates/PIs
so ur saying good mage player went arc/fire
and shitters went arc/frost
wonder why?
so why did he play arc/fire
could it be that its better spec?
yea and they had arc/fire in their last run too
well progress was 2-3 mins ahead of the wr
with many deaths
and they had even more fire locks this time
arc/fire is worth it with any number of locks tbh
just say you dont want to support the raid
and its fine
wrong info?
is this some mage psyop
no you innervate affli locks imp
maybe its a 2 warlock guild :Pepeclown:
maybe he got mindstorm + fang
or boots of blasting
and how many packs do you kill per raid?
you will probably replace oblivion in ZA patch
if you have tailoring atleast
pantaloons will be insane
if you have to use any shadow bolts with oblivion set
its massive dps loss
ZA has so many haste items
you will never be using oblivion most likely
theres haste chest too
shoulders
legs
no way mag gloves is good on seed set bro
use 3x crit gem SS
hunter works too
hunter barely loses anything applying debuffs
proper melee loses a lot of uptime moving
when they could be cleaving
you dont need noggies now
but in next phase sure
chain of the twilight owl / eye of the night
warlock never uses green sp
@shygo locks in good guilds cant get 99 on morogrim
lady vashj & KT are very hard to 99 in good guilds too
afking in p2 & p3 destroys ur dps
people wont be speedrunning post nerf
no point
yeah the timeline is issue
post nerf content will be out like 1 month
before t6
vs 3-4 months of prenerf
not reallyt
there wil lbe new tech up to post nerf
but if you speedrun postnerf content, every prenerf run was waste of time
TLC is just shit on warlocks
sextant is very strong when not aoe capped
if i had sextant  would use it always on seeding probably
you can use rocket boots like 8 times in a speedrun atm
its 100% required if going for top 10 times
yes point of speedrun is going as fast as possible
large part of raid is spent doing ST dmg
well depends on comp
and what version of muru we get
if theres spell pushback idk if we can kill it rn
spell pushback muru was actually hard
but if theres no pushback
you just stack warlocks and its free loot
why would you ever drop ench for tailoring
you want to do less dps?
haste and both crit are way more dps in swp gear
so could easily be more than 25 dps
engi on solarian is literally useless
does nothing
seed sapper into death
:pepebrain:
cba to ask for bop
nah
if you seed when they are running
and sapper
you die
ferals? :Pepeclown:
tailoring
:peepohigh:
i wonder how much dps ele gains from zd
over mace+oh
:Pepeclown:
thats false
do you think ele scales?
@Krusty last i heard ZD is 20-30 dps upgrade for spriests over mindblade+oh
i doubt thats true
and ZD is 20-30 dps upgrade for locks over toc+chronicle
even more on aoe
wait
are you saying spriests gain 40 dps
?
or moonkins?
who are known to run oom
or eles known for not scaling at all
from anything
yes and mace+oh is close to ZD
on ele/moonkin/spriest
ZD goes to locks/mages
because it scales their aoe
why not?
if you give ZD to locks/mages
raid will be over faster
why is ele doing 2.1k on that sheet
?
they do like 1.1k currently
i doubt ele is going to get 1k boost next phase
shaman can maybe hit 2k on cleave fight
never on ST
why not
?
spriest isnt getting haste rings
warlocks scale even better
especially on aoe
which is what we will be doing most of the time next phase
https://i.nuuls.com/KVZp9.png
lets give ele shaman omega bis guys
and spriest 2x haste rings+ZD
so they can hit some haste breakpoint and do 5 dps more
no?
it literally doesnt
giving warlock more loot boosts isb uptime
giving spriest more loot does nothing
i would rather keep locks around
@Blow how many spriests does raid have and how many locks
ele wont be doing 2.1k on st next phase
whats wrong with you
toc+chronicle is 2 loots
ele does 1.6k ?
if you arent in top guild and ZD is going to spriest
what will locks do?
you really want to keep locks around
not really?
no they dont get like 90 dps
toc+chronicle is very strong for arcanes
https://i.nuuls.com/svM8n.png
ZD
https://i.nuuls.com/HbLfH.png
toc+chronicle
7 target aoe
@gremmer🐢 normal t6 bis
you arent threat capped really on aoe atm
oblivion is maybe worth it next phase if under aoe cap
well giving prot pala 4pc t6 wont help with that
you always need to wait for consecration tick
sure if you have prot pala MT
give him first 4pc
but if hes only tanking aoe trash no point
@Blow https://kristoferhh.github.io/WarlockSimulatorTBC/
go sim it
no?
deep destro is better
13 dps over exalted rep ring
@Xavus have you seen Shadow and Flame talent?
its even better in next phase
succubus wont survive anything
deep destro is just better in every way
no?
healer cloak
boots
belt
haste bracers
and all the 12sp gems ofc
other classes can take other loot
going from mindblade+badge OH to ZD is literal 30 dps upgrade on spriests
im not even kidding
4pc t5 isnt good for spriests?
wtf
i thought it was their bis
not that we gave them any prio on it
:pepebrain:
is 2pc spellstrike spriest bis?
cowl + legs is bis?
i dont remember name
cowl isnt better?
spriests are something else
ours was saying 4pc t5 was bis
and 2pc spellstrike was bis
etc
and they have private sim
:peepohigh:
im pretty fucking sure haste rings arent even spriest bis
:peepohigh:
bro
exalted ring + 42 sp ring
with hit/crit
ring of captured storms / band of the eternal sage
pretty sure thats best for spriests
why would spriest ever use 2x haste rings over exalted ring
what the fuck
ZD boosts isb uptime
mages dont gain 100% of haste value on aoe
if they use MQG & IV
@Aloysius haste? :peepohigh:
@Aloysius faster you cast shadowbolts, less spriest ruins the isb uptime
@KilLogic who do you think is getting most caster loot?
@Blow you can go sim seed dps :pepebrain:
warlocks have public sim(s)
@Krusty warlocks dont hit some magical haste cap, more is more
so its a zergling?
how did it get to warcraft world
https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/87027-zhardoom-greatstaff-of-the-devourer.jpg
it doesnt look like a felhunter tbh
i think its a zergling camouflaged as a felhunter
dont take KT cloak my dude
give it to spriests/prot palas
do spriests have sim for multidotting?
:Pepeclown:
im pretty sure sp would be bis stat there
eles & boomkins gain 200-300 dps on aoe?
boomies exist?
they are getting cut pretty hard
ele is a shaman
you need atleast 5
are you going give eles/spriests ZD and then DE every mace?
while locks&mages get jack shit while doing 2x of their dps
theres 6-10 mages/locks in raids
and like 2 spriest/ele in raid
what about pvp dagger?
or mace
:peepohigh:
!skull
worse your guild is more important its to give loot to best players/classes
scb will be better in next phase with longer fights tho?
more hit for filler and obviously more mana'
oh so mages still have infinite mana?
nice to know
mages say that trinket isnt good
:pepebrain:
isnt that trinket 100% uptime on trash
how can they say its bad
everyone is taking skull
but you can have both
is it?
skull is lock only item
most guilds run 2-4 locks
well your guild wont have many locks after that
have fun with that
do mages really say permanent 150 haste isnt good
but they say IV is good?
@Blow yeah thats why every guild is recruiting locks
:Pepeclown:
@Jujutsu you can use both?
even if you split raid, most loot is going to mages/locks
quags isnt 100% uptime
that trinket is
exalted rep trinket?
every mage should use that always when using AE
what other trinket would mage use?
MQG and?
@Jujutsu so haste isnt a good stat on mages? thanks for confirming my feelscraft
?
losing one support class is nothing
way bigger deal to lose locks especially if they are pumpers
you recruit another one or make healer go spriest
https://i.nuuls.com/hF87B.png
love mage discord
they havent even thought about going arc/fire
yeah
now they want to go fire
when it gets them more loot
if they are unironically thinking about going fire next phase
they will try to steal everything especially skull
arcane is more dps next phase
and basically want 0 items
why would arcane mage want skull
they think their class trinket is shit
no skull no warlocks
are locks upset?
skull is orc prio bro
its probably 1-2 min sim
with 2-3 innervates and PI ofc
ZD is probably -+ 0 on ISB uptime compared to toc+chronicle
why isnt haste cloak realistic btw?
its pretty big upgrade on seeding
and we will be seeding a lot
?? do u guys think haste somehow wont improve ISB uptime?
crit difference is literally minimal
it reduces the isb uptime loss from death/mb
haste doesnt affect spriests at all
death / mb have cooldown
its not minor?
its the main reason we will never hit high numbers
@KilLogic they could just stack more sp
mace+oh, rings, cloak, pvp dagger / OH
many items have more sp
@Aloysius they dont have a sim
i still havent heard how much dps does spriest gain from hitting this magical haste breakpoint
which is what number btw?
mages just dont want to support other classes
simple as that
they are complaining about priests not going disc
and havent mentioned arc/fire EVER
arc/fire is super strong atm
mages got too cocky because they peaked now
if this discord is right and ZD is 1/5
every caster should have it eventually
some people here said its 7/5 tables
non weapons / weapons
well vestments is 1/6
and this phase is going to be shorter than p3 p4
yea thats the 2nd part of toc/ZD thing
if you take ZD, gl getting swp OH / MH
well it is pretty important for seeding
you dont?
most of us have bowiz for seeding
:peepohigh:
do mages really ?
:peepohigh:
warlocks are literally getting hard cucked by blizzard atm
we are losing 10% on seed dps
everyone go file a bug report right now
:peepohigh:
maybe it gets fixed before swp
seed explosions arent popping other locks seeds either right?
so if you pop other locks seed, does his seeds pop also your other seeds?
t5 legs is best place to gem 12sp bro
:peepohigh:
hydross chest should be better?
with full crit gems
i dont have 99 on KT/vashj/morogrim
:peepohigh:
literally impossible
seeding pet is actually 1000 IQ
:pepebrain:
:peepohigh:
we are so overgeared also its not even fun
people entered BT in original tbc with dogshit gear
we will be t5 bis
yeah
like it should have been done on classic too
nah
BT will filter a lot of guilds
it will be very long
mount hyjal too
nah
blizz nerfs content
well we still dont know if haste gems are in
why isnt ZD smart way to gear?
what do you mean
mages want t6 legs
so that leaves what ele spriest and moonkin(if you have one)
there was a mage here saying t6 legs is better
for mages
so idk what you on gfoty
ofc you dont take leggings if you have vestments
but if you dont why would other casters have higher prio on them?
yeah
mage t6 legs actually insane
19 int more
@Aloysius so do you unironically think arcane mages should take channeled elements?
its a shaman
yeah melees are going to pump bro
:Pepeclown:
many classes scale terribly next phase
you still gotta bring utility
only furies and locks scale
whats this argument
rogue is ST class
we spend most of the raid killing aoe packs
why would you want more healers?
almost everyone has too many healers
what do you mean
locks use 3% hit
people will cut enhas before eles tbh
swp gear has like 0 hit
you actually need ele shaman
oh we know meta comp already?
enh is melee
yeah illidan real melee friendly fight
whats the argument for not stacking locks?
1 fight being bad for them?
this is demo tank?
idk bro
can VW even survive
healers still need to heal him
warriors are crush immune with shield block up
but there will be bosses that cant crush in next phase
maybe there lock tank could work
tbc gear is almost instantly replaced in wotlk tho
especially non swp gear
yeah wrath wont be that popular
thats why blizz is trying to milk tbc as long as possible
muh ulduar
Belf locks have great class fantasy
:peepohigh:
or orc male
(female) ofc
belf is 2nd best racial after orcs
and in some cases even better
tremor totem?
idk permanent +10sp is pretty good
bloodthistle
well if you cant use blood fury because of heal debuff
belf racial is better
you can carry infinite amount of bloodthistle
just buy from AH
nah
its normal herb flower in belf starting area
you can either buy them or go herb on alt
bloodthistle is a belf racial
https://i.nuuls.com/wVX8k.png
????
only belfs can use that
its a racial
if you let bloodthistle buff drop
you get -spirit debuff
what table?
just buy them off AH
bro
MD/ruin is literally shit spec
forget it even exists
demo is better in aoe because ur felguard pumps
while seed is aoe capped anyway
@gremmer🐢 it doesnt?
:peepohigh:
dont go MD/ruin
@Aloysius so looks like mages are going toc+chronicle
idk
progress had a lot of deaths last run
maybe holy could have prevented them
maybe holy could have prevented vashj wipe
no way
you are seeding half of the raid
where IDS does nothing
aslong as you have deaths, can you say you dont need coh?
https://i.nuuls.com/0eOX5.png
mage discord is peak content
they just want raid dps up probably
IDS
160 dps on ST
half of the raid is  aoe
they run warlock heavy raid too
so healing isnt a problem really
39 SR OH?
👀
warlock can go 0 sr probably
well use neck+priest buff
rocket boots best piece anyway for that fight
you can always zerg it
with neck+priest buff
boss has 3.9m hp dude
ill just use runed stygian
if SR is actually required
nah
idk
greens are like 500g
runed stygian is like 200g per piece
i have AQ cloak tho
15 SR enchant on that+neck
is already shitload of SR
going 200 res unbuffed with greens
makes the fight harder
3k / sec from fatal attraction i think
if its prenerf
but nether protection basically makes you immune to FA
its more like huhuran
beams will be 100% healable
SR on mother is all about not dying to unlucky FA teleport
middle of the raid
@Xelrog you know you can get healed?
based on wowhead comments will hit 9-11k unresisted
neck+buff+one piece should be easily doable
yea
should be pretty common drop
i vendored my runed stygian :pepehands:
chest isnt even that good tho
idk vestments is pretty big piece
well yeah thats one way to get SR
gem 3x res on SS
etc
is the SR OH called "of shadow protection"
or something else?
its 12 SR and shitload of stats
you can just switch crit gems to resistance week 1
if you have t5 chest
can use 3x res  gems there too
thats already FREE 24 Sr
and shitload of stats
t5 shoulders
8 SR
we are looking at 32 sr for free atm
handwraps of flowing thought with 2x resistance gems + spell hit enchant
thats a free piece too
guys
how the fuck do i have 2x 12sp pvp gems?
https://i.nuuls.com/f-EyO.png
https://i.nuuls.com/AJC0r.png
how?
oh yeah cant equip 2nd piece with 12sp
did it always work like this?
how?
it is really
people underestimate how long hyjal/bt will be
prenerf KT was 99% rng
0 ptr release would be nice
if something is broken its broken
really?
seed bug is still ingame
and i cant even figure out how to do bug report ingame
:Pepeclown:
how do i even make a bug report
you had locks in caster stack?
0 iq
how the fuck does vashj drop dogshit loot every week
:peepohigh:
what the fuck
why do you see other locks dots?
i use elvui and only see personal debuffs
elvui has different system probably
idk what addon you are using
https://i.nuuls.com/Ni1x0.png
just create filter with shit you want to see
scorch , shadow weaving other locks coe & cor
its not a lot of work tbh
:peepohigh:
KT 99 is impossible
vashj 99 is impossible
morogrim 99 is impossible
great fucking tier blizzard
@Soggy Lumps do you afk 1 min in p2
:peepohigh:
and 30s in p3
anyone got link to that mage sim on toc vs ZD
someone posted it here
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RVUhrf47O1x6xXvK_qFtpilaB7NHkNmZutzwdsHbGRM/edit#gid=0
good shit
@degenerate you sure? :Pepeclown:
sometimes people have it equipped on boss with 91 hit
:Pepeclown:
prism isnt trash
:peepohigh:
fetish is trash too?
@Fira so doing less threat is trash
but fetish isnt trash?
in what case do you usually pull aggro? (when you crit a lot)
you understand how threat mechanic works
you either pull aggro or you dont
prism helps you to not pull aggro
fetish is very hard to use in raids too
30s is very long time to not have any trinket
i dont use fetish at all
but have prism pretty much always when seeding
it reduces your chance of dying to lucky crits
very good trinket
so fetish is dogshit too right?
why not?
always throw atleast 2 curses
no reason not to coe
could petrified scarab be good for illidan tanking?
aq40 trinket
pala tanks are using it atleast
boomies?
no?
spriest takes wand next phase
what do you mean cuck
spriest not keeping shadow weaving up cucks us
Warrior is already done
Feral just better tho
You only probably want warrior on illidan
But pala can tank too
Skycrab was saying glad weapon is bis this phase
Its not
You can always get hit elsewhere
And hit on dagger is dead stat half of the raid
Bowiz is literally dogshit tho
Most people lose dps if they use bowiz
Because of swaps etc
Oh i bought bowiz to test it
Barely worth it
Maybe on aoe cap and assuming its not on icd
Lowest ofc
Idk what they do
In most packs you have nuke targets
And seed still scales from sp
Nether mages?
Yeah we seed too, but you go below aoe cap
If its not on icd
Just swap after proc, but its hard to do perfectly
@Skycrab you were spreading fake news on mage discord few hours ago
:peepohigh:
and mages said skull is bis for them on aoe
:peepohigh:
while they have that sick rep trinket AND mqg
hellfire still is insane
:peepohigh:
just need haste snapshot
does hellfire even have haste cap
you use barely any destros tho
maybe on trash
dark runes are most expensive consumable
yea on single target trash mobs
giants in ssc
no you use mana pots on most fights
marco didnt go fem human?
spirit buff from IDS tho
:pepebrain:
thats like almost 1 dps more
why cant locks be draeneis
:pepehands:
bro
why wouldnt you want to be draenei
you will drop immolate for sure if no imp scorch next phase
but raids should have imp scorch
will be big for mother
healing ring / healer shoulders / healer gloves / plate chest
literally 90% of drops
blizz hates warlocks
? seed is literally broken
blizz does nothing
because they hate us
if mages did 10% less dmg
would have been insta fixed
if furies did 0.001% less dmg
it would have been insta fixed
imagine if locks had A SINGLE DECENT class trinket
even one
from vanilla or tbc
mages getting way too cocky
just look at the hunters
and you see whats going to happen
well warlock was top 1 dps first phase
and this phase too
https://i.nuuls.com/NoDP1.png
those fuckers are actually insane
:Pepeclown:
WHY IS TOC+OH BIS
I WANT STAFF
BUT HASTE
AND STAFF
I WANT STAFF REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
well ZD is actually zergling camouflaged as felhunter
nah
mages take toc+oh first
@Mentis what do you mean? haste OH from swp is bis
if ur giving mages toc first
you give them OH too
yes theres only 1-2 mages
3-4 locks
so you will have toc+oh going to locks too
not really
you will go over cap with mh+oh always
ZD is best for locks
no one else gets same benefit from it really
@Quazle they take the mace
raid has 2-3 palas
2 priests
3-4 locks
wdym
t5 is free roll in our raids
if ur playing casually
no reason to cut boomie
no one parses
no one cares about parses
yeah telling people to go afk on KT/vasjh/morogrim is "fun"
well top 1 TK run is running boomie
boomie is still very good if you have shadow locks
whats wrong with this guy
is he mentally ill?
this is why you dont parse
:Pepeclown:
well hes parsing in tbc
and making youtube videos
imagine wiping on one mob because your master dies
OH NO NO NO NO NO
people underestima combat rezz imo
and ISB uptime from moonkin aura
https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/25654-zhardoom-greatstaff-of-the-devourer.jpg
its a zergling right?
https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/33303-felhound.jpg
doesnt look like a felhound
https://i.nuuls.com/ivdKy.png
fuck locks
:Pepeclown:
mage discord also says locks wont beat them in t6
nah
locks just scale insanely
fights will be longer
3.1m sounds post nerf
mother has 3.9m
looks like we found the answer boys
its a zergling staff
https://i.nuuls.com/SnONr.png
pretty threat wasnt even a thing in wotlk
in wotlk you pull whole dungeon
aoe it down
i did coom tho
:peepohigh:
haste makes isb uptime higher too
dont forget haste belt is way better on aoe
take it
dont take illidan helm
you miss out on wings
legs will be easy to get too
mages take t6 legs
eles and balances want vestments too
will guilds cuck locks who never got vestments? no they wont most likely
pretty sure spriest can go for tailor shoulders too
haste is good stat for them right?
only non vestments locks really want elements
id take wand over chest right now
wand will always be bis next phase
You should use kara ring for seeding peepo
you should give skycrab mage role
yeah if fight ends exactly after 21 bolt
you get an extra bolt
you kinda want to open with immolate
so you dont pull aggro
immolate good on leo
decent on vashj
skull is warlock only item
simple as that
you will NEED imp scorch next phase
if we get scuffed prismatic shield on mother
chinese logs
:Pepeclown:
threat is usually fine after 2 globals
kt has better version of glaives
gear doesnt matter on fury
who wouldnt want to fuck capernian?
:peepohigh:
maybe we could get seed fixed when BT ptr comes
and we bug report it?
i think BT/hyjal ptr will be our best shot at getting seed fixed
pretty sure they are
palas stun them sometimes
well losing 10-15% seed dmg is pretty fucking big
@Scanlawn how many locks are you running
2 locks are always hard cucked
well if ur running 3 locks
only 1 has chance to even beat a mage
and locks are like 10x harder to play than mages
already have mage alt
requires actually 0 iq
easiest class in whole game
imp scorch will be 100% required next phase
for every guild
so gl going arc/frost
mother prismatic shield
if its adaptive, you cant have every lock shadow
yea eat the 70% dmg loss
:Pepeclown:
ur thinking post nerf
prenerf prismatic shield is adaptive
more specific element dmg you deal
more resistance it gets
so if ur running 4 shadow locks+spriest
its going to be like 50-60% dmg reduction
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAsGBT0kWzU&ab_channel=Bosslandx
you can see in this video how it works
im expecting mother to be hardest boss in bt tbh
especially if caster heavy
depends on prismatic shield on what prismatic shield we get
if its prenerf going to be hard
i dont know how exactly it works
well as you can see
nihilum is casting incinerates pre 2.4
if it wasnt required, they wouldnt have done it
sure you can do it without imp scorch
but why would you
just makes the fight harder
thing is, mage doesnt lose much at all going arc/fire
as we can see from speedruns
?
if every lock in ur raid is shadow bolting
they are doing 60-70% less dmg
well you would much rather have mage just applying scorches and otherwise doing arcane dmg
on mother
looks like it changes every 15s
or 10s
check the video
its not rng dude
it recalculates dmg reduction every 10-15s
if you do 90% shadow dmg in that period
it reduces a lot of shadow dmg for next 15s
mage stays arcane for sure next phase
but raid dps wise shadow will be bis next phase
but on mother if its prenerf prismatic you need to split
thats not false
its 40 dps difference dude
in full bis
https://youtu.be/CAsGBT0kWzU?t=531
they pretty much only cast fire spells
and then she does prismatic shield fire 9
after that they switch to frost/shadow
and then she does shadow 8 / frost 4 prismatic shield
im not sure how much she reduces dmg per one prismatic shield
5 / 10 % maybe
well i just explained how it works
if its prenerf shield
and you can see from the video how it works
yeah sure they could do post nerf mechanics
but i doubt that
@JordanF thats post nerf prismatic shield
3 schools is ideal
arcane/fire/shadow
or 2 if you switch every 15s
:peepohigh:
im the only one who has even thought about prismatic shield and you want to ban me
tbh prenerf prismatic shield is very brutal
they might not do it
if you run scuffed comp
casters literally dont do any dmg
what compromise
its lock item
ZD is 10 dps upgrade for mages too
over toc+chronicle
UNLUCKY
wand isnt even contested?
only locks really want it
mges nexus key
spriest kt cloak
you didnt get them in p1?
its like 500-600
on ST
on aoe its insane
how much mages get?
like 100?
and go oom in longer fights
mages doing dogshit frostbolt rotation isnt oom?
really?
locks go for haste belt
aoe
haste gems would be so good
yellows would be actually used
0 is very risky
4 hits and no proc and ur dead
neck+buff+cloak+rocket boots is the play probably
buffed?
fury copers
they sit afk half of illidan
and thats 600 dps on ST
will be way way more on aoe
https://i.nuuls.com/ot_zK.png
pumper mage
almost t5 bis and curator staff
:pepe_ok:
no one hs cancelled lmao
it was a meme
even unbuffed
it was a meme
especially on horde
it was full meme
@Jujutsu i dont have spriest dude
idk
its our alt raid
ofc you go arc/fire instead of fire
its just better
even in swp i think
arc/fire is better
takes 0 lock loot
this is mages peak
ur not getting any lock loot later
arc/frost is a meme imo
brings nothing to raid and requires more support
99% of mages are griefers
doesnt laty still run 2x bm grp
wrong
havent said that much
mages are getting toc+chronicle next phase atleast
:peepohigh:
:T5peepo:
pala should just take the mace
They disappear when u pull morogrim
Jump thing didnt work last time i tried
Fucking blizz we got the worst possible version of 4pc
@spoar did you run in same direction as spout
oh
what race are you
dont be gnome
works on my machine
use nogger or something
tell blizz to fix it
its supposed to either boost every locks dots or buff whole dmg by 10%
we got the ultra omega shit version
imagine if it boosted total dmg and every locks dots
it would maybe compete with mage 2pc
:pepebrain:
too bad blizz hard cucks us always
thats total dmg right
not base?
no way
thats exponential growth
they dont know arcane/fire is a spec+
we killed vashj with an alt raid yesterday
3 arcane mages no spriest
idk how people struggle
imagine doing gdkps
1.2k for what
4h raid?
priests will take mace+oh
and they will be happy
or pvp dagger if they are pumpers
https://i.nuuls.com/6LnZx.png
pvp mace
look how cool it is
ZD is 200 dps upgrade
trust me guys
:pepebrain:
nah
@Kristofer can you fix the sim a bit
make ZD better
how do you define pumpers?
caring about sunflare is not smart
you might never see it
do ele shamans even want chronicle
or do they use shield
!skull
the fake zd one?
with shamans getting 70 dps from it?
yea spriest and moonkin taking skull is great system
it was fixed im pretty sure
to more realistic number
trinkets arent that important ho
skull is barely a upgrade for non locks
820
dkp is actually the worst system
haste also makes you tap faster
did you know giving locks ZD gives spriests dps
and mages mana
giving skull to mages is peak clown
THE peak clown
@Scanlawn ok you cast coe this week
oh wait mages cant?
try to beat curse bots my dude
while playing arc/frost and griefing the raid
well mages are most likely forced to play arc/fire next phase
but arc/fire is anyway bis spec
idk why mages play frost cope
arc/fire literally doesnt need innervate
its the superior spec
it doesnt?
casting 20% faster with AP makes you oom pretty hard
yes?
its both dude
you pop IV+AP and go oom
and 5x scorch or 1x scorch 2fb is just better filler
blizzard does dmg
why would you do r1
?
casting spells burns mana
so why cast them at all
yea bro 2-3k ticks is trash
cast r1
well if mobs die at same time then its 0 value
but if they dont oblivion is big
on morogrim its dogshit
bag thing wont work most likely
its mage bis next phase too
arc/fire isnt worth it?
are you trolling
arc/fire loses literally nothing in ssc
why wouldnt you run arc/fire
its not
mages dont have infinite mana
first 2 bosses you can be fire for free
on vashj free switch
yeah spending less mana while doing same dps
that sounds horrible
how often are you full mana in a super fast speedrun
and?
imp scorch is very big
even if locks arent fire
and locks can be fire on 3-4 bosses for free
immolate,sappers,nades,enh shaman
and its a mage who doesnt need any special support
just spriest
its better than sim says bro
:Pepeclown:
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/CwpJDa2dLHT6bgWR#boss=-3&start=0&end=2736813&type=summary
can we get explanation on this @Foolipe
how did this happen
when arc/fire is literally dogshit spec which cant compete?
progress has bad mages?
okay
i dont even understand why would mage ever want to play arc/frost
do u guys enjoy begging for more support?
well arc/fire loses a lot of value in TK
useless on alar
trash isnt fire friendly at all
like FLK trash is
proggres showed 8 locks is pretty good comp
running 12 locks atm is pretty hard
could easily be meta next phase tho
mages way too cocky
just wait for next phase
enha is floor pov
ele is just superior dps shaman'
how is resto leftover
literally as good as ele
for mages
and spriest
spriest doesnt need hit or crit either
oh so more mana isnt good in long fight?
would nice grp if ur fire
it is tho
yes it is bis
especially next phase
spriest should be big for seeding
very big
? lock goes always oom seeding
how do i add spriest to hildi sim
ideal?
ideal lock grp is boomie+ele+spriest+hunter+lock
these mages are getting way too cocky
hopefully blizz releases t6 asap
do priests really?
:peepohigh:
cant do math
:peepohigh:
zergling staff is lock item
no skull no locks,
no ZD no cor
:peepohigh:
why wouldnt priests go holy nova?
its free dps
i havent seen vestments since week 1
been #1 on them ofc
:peepohigh:
was nota even ahead before wipe
they started timer way late
i think after alar
well oblivion is pure crit set too
you arent casting any shadow bolts on lurker trash
so no point in having non oblivion set
who cares
seed something
if you see wrath totem missing because ele is griefing
cast on murlocs
why are u guys discussing morogrim,
literally doesnt matter
and will matter even less in 2-3 weeks
oh so it was a practice run?
:Pepeclown:
anyone got accurate timer
would be nice to know if they even had a chance
i think they wiped earlier too
does sald bakers still use lock tank on leo?
if ur going for speedrun
why would you use lock tank
whole point of speedrun is to go as fast as possible
paladin is just safer
cant get fucked by shit rng
top 1 run uses pala tank im pretty sure
progress uses pala tank
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/CnHvVd4Bm9GDt6Jr#type=damage-taken&fight=10&ability=37675
gendhis took 0 dmg from chaos bolts?
or u mean pala?
they pala tanked it 100%
@krieg pretty sure its pala problem
Kebab is just easier to play
Nice stam
Channeled elements arent that contested tho
Vestment locks, mages dont want them
That leaves what ele and spriest?
Most people switched off tailoring
So not an option really unless ur going to spend around 5k switching professions sgain
T6 bis isnt that hard tbh, depends on skull rng and how rare rings are
Haste belt wont be that contested
Haste belt? Its massive
It is for total dps
!skull
You have to prio skull to locks, other classes just dont get same benefit
Kt and vashj is whatever too
Only boss dps should matter on vashj/kt
If you do p2 p3 too fast you lpse a lot of dps
Easy? No
Kt vashj moro all equally hard to 99
Yea if you want good parse on kt/vashj people need to go afk
More raid dps you have, less dps ur going to do on vashj/kt
im not casting shadow ward
if priest doesnt shield then i die
mages dont swap to fire
yeah they switch to fire because they want to steal all the loot
they chose arc/frost
let them play arcane
but if we get prenerf prismatic shield, raids really will want imp scorch
arc/fire will be best raid dps wise
if prenerf prismatic shield
even more than its now
how long is this sim
1 min?
can you do 4-5 min
will be more realistic probably
!skull
VR?
wowhead comments are always right
:peepohigh:
best place to research mechanics
yea set bonus is broken
because blizz hates locks
seed is still broken
i deleted runed stygian gear
:pepehands:
4HM will be hard boss if no zerg strat
if blizz changes shield wall mechanic on 4hM you wont be able to zerg it
if they will do both shield walls
zerg tactic wont work
no way
raid dies
and with timeline & nobuffs
people wont have that much stam
:peepohigh:
this is the general here
no i didnt
why
naxx at 70 is free
how can sapph be hard
people not standing behind blocks ?
you have shitload of natural resist tho
its like lvl 60 spell
pretty sure
viscidus is free atleast
well the spell is low lvl still
i resisted literally everything viscidus did
going for 300 SR makes the fight harder
if using piece of shit greens
just use resistance gems
:peepohigh:
SS legs
dont trust sims kids
if you hit specific breakpoint yes
if you dont
int is useless
@Zuzandir kino
i might go full clown and go with double pvp yellows on vestments
(if i ever get it)
hybrid and full crit one my dude
optimal leo set is having paladin tank it
could be p5
you mean handegg games?
daily reminder to bug report seed bug
:peepohigh:
you should always survive FA
its 3k ticks
you will have like 11k hp
shadow ward
healthstone
https://i.nuuls.com/r2nyj.png
its not looking good
warlock comps wont be able to get amani war bear
:pepehands:
FLK is 4 target seed
if you seed off pet
yep
just need 60% crit to get decent parse
https://i.nuuls.com/cOJCQ.png
99 btw
:peepohigh:
does eye of the night double dip on imp
imp scales off your sp
:peepohigh:
strat living MC buff mb
theres no fire dmg if starting on lurker
they just prepop it for leo packs
it only matters if ur kill time is around 2 mins
if its more or less doesnt really affect destro vs mana pot
you go oom on lurker with lust tho
so idk
could also use instants or just sit in the water
Z is lifetap
why would u put epic gems on non bis pieces
75-80 is pretty normal
85% if lucky
well feral doesnt need to take dmg rly
but warrior always needs to take dmg
paladin needs to be tanking something
grim reach is best talent in affli tree
after malediction
always take it
36 yard destro spells and 30 affli spells as affli
is actual grief
CANT play
on trash 6 yard extra range is very strong
can get one curse off like 1s earlier
extra seed range on solarian packs alone makes it worth it
and best talent
why would affli tank capernian
why?
you cast 1-2 sp and then shadow bolt
soaker can apply dagger debuff
?
we have warrior tank soak & apply dagger no problem
on capernian
just needs to run in and hit when shes casting
@Mayhem you dont run 2 spriests
you just cut mages if healers rly need spriest
2 spriest hard griefs mother
2nd one brings literally nothing dps wise
if healers need spriest
you just run one arc/fire mage
thats 3 healers with spriest and innervates for healers too
deep fire is grief
but arc/fire wont need that much mana support especially next phase
you have spriest?
spriest+mage+3 healers
whats the problem
arcane fortitude wont be that important next phase probably
its only good for vashj & leo atm
dont need it on vashj
but yeah its very good
dont run 2 spriests kids
why would you
2nd spriest brings nothing to raid
healers dont need it
why grief locks and 2nd spriest
then you cut mages and put more healers into spriest grp?
lower isb = both spriests do less dps
every lock does less dps
locks have been top dps for last 2 phases now
whats wrong with mages
hunters are already dogshit and will be worse
warlocks will be biggest winners anyway
fury close 2nd
most furies will never get glaives
they will tho
4% drop chance per glaive
do 25 resets and you should have one set
if average rng
some guilds will get full set in 5 resets
other guilds never
and if your guild runs rogue
glaives is whole game bis for them
furys replace them
overdosing on fury cope
sad case
well laty wiped their speedrun
because they kept cleaving FLK
should just run warlock comp like normal people
you profit from raiding tho
full clear is like 200g
warlocks use 2x flask,1 brilliant wizard oil and some mana pots
you raided 20 hours?
with both weapons oiled
well tanks really need to have 100% attendance
dont really need 3rd tank
you run 2 locks?
thats very bad
and you shouldnt be affli in this raid comp
in normal raids i would only run affli if you have 4 locks
and one cant fit in ele grp
you have massive gaps in casting sometimes
hydross pull
you dont cast anything after coe for long time
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/G3fZpgBXPCJt4rFw#fight=5&type=casts&source=8&view=timeline
this is my hydross
only gaps are because i havent done /qcs macro for dark rune / destro pot
first interrupt was because of switch i think
why didnt he innervate himself
especially if other lock is affli
uptime is probably pretty bad
https://maarslet.github.io/DebuffCheck/
i just checked ur logs
no one is griefing
are you sure you see ISB if other locks apply it?
some people have scuffed UI
pretty sure neck just gives your grp 5 min buff
doesnt matter if you go out of range
probably not
thing is buff will just disappear to beams
and do basically nothing for FA
https://i.nuuls.com/--qUM.png
why havent i ever seen this be mentioned
shartuul event
its 2nd bis for ST  probably
do shartuul event
rep exalted ring is better for seeding
we just gave wand to spriest
every lock had it
:peepohigh:
https://maarslet.github.io/DebuffCheck/
use this for isb uptime
85% is doable with good rng
number of warlocks doesnt matter rly
:peepohigh:
where the fuck is my vestments
:peepohigh:
was it good run?
been #1 on vestments since week 2
not a single vestments
oh well hopefully haste gems are in
:peepohigh:
elements is like 1-2 dps worse
even with sp gems
and t6 chest looks way cooler
its not bis for all casters
its barely bis for locks
shamans just oom faster if you give them haste
:peepohigh:
haste cloak is omega bis for seeding
haste is omega bis for seeding
:peepohigh:
its not wasted because seed is dogshit scaling ability
especially when aoe capped
no skull, no locks
no zd no cor
for locks both haste rings are bis
other classes probably want exalted + 1 haste ring
yea
obviously caster rings
what spriest wants haste ring over exalted ring?
i dont think so
ele and moonkin both oom faster because of haste
well it is only good for locks
and what run 6 healers?
or floor pov enha
@Ryusei well how many classes use quags over double icon?
i think thats the best way to look at what classes want haste
and what classes dont
lets look at the classes who run double icon: moonkins, mages, spriests, elemental shamans.
lets look at the classes who run quags: warlock
i really doubt that
its 15 dps on warlocks
if they love haste so much
why arent they running quags
so its because haste scales mainly from how much dps you do?
and double haste ring is barely bis on locks
wdym rolled wrong fotm class?
how am i moving goalposts
exalted rep ring is just pretty good
more dps you do, better haste is
lol yes
other stats = dps pretty much
yeah?
are you saying moonkin gains as much dps from 1 crit as warlocks?
its not fun at all
0
ZD is better for seeding always
yeah im angry bro
:Pepeclown:
not wrong
lets go sim ZD vs bowiz
in 10-30s sim, bowiz+chronicle beats ZD by 80 dps
how many 10-30s fights will be having?
on 30-60s ZD already wins
archimonde has free taps?
downtime? :pepehands:
why would you always destro pot
mana pot is more shadow bolts / incinerates
higher isb uptime is personal dps increase
:peepohigh:
You are tho
Only locks want spellthread anyway
Other classes just use kt neck
Use haste belt
If no haste gems
Haste is always bis for seeding
And you will be seeding alot
For st its almost same as sp
Barely
Well belt
Gems
Well trash
But haste is only real way to scale seed
So doesnt matter
You can always cut hit, go for crit/sp gems
Kazzak cloak is 0 stam
Its a bait
We take both krymer
Hf paying 1-2k per raid so you can lose to locks
Fury bros its over
Flask / elixir swapping, scrolös, haste pots
Yap
Nah
We pop 40g flask and are done
Spirit scroll? U trolling
Tap walk
Next phase we come back
Mother will require firelocks if prenerf
Why would you ever run full fire when arc/fire is best mage spec
Not for locks
And rocket boots basically remove FA
How the fuck do we get seed fixed
I cant, theres no way to make bug report ingame
And dont have lvl 10 character on NA
prismatic shield is adaptive
it switches dmg mitigation every 10-15s based on what dmg you dealt in last period
well 2 different strats probably
you split warlocks into fire/shadow
and everyone dps normally
or you switch between shadow/fire
every 15s
bro ur talking about post nerf prismatic shield
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAsGBT0kWzU&ab_channel=Bosslandx
check this video if you want to see prenerf
i just explained it
its adaptive
no
if you deal a lot of shadow dmg
she gets prismatic shield shadow 9
which is 90% dmg reduction
actually you can see prismatic shield duration below this guys buffs
its 15s
idk looks like splitting wont work
so you have to rotate
https://i.nuuls.com/X_RKq.png
80% fire reduction and 50% shadow reduction at same time
nihilum world first
yea
you rotate
it does
if you dont cast dont do any fire spells
yeah and now that i watched video again, it wont work
yea wont work
like i said 3 messages above
oh another fight club guy
rent free
hes just lying ofc
i would NEVER deny holocaust
no you switch school every 15s
or everyone will do shit dps
illidan will be vashj/kt tier
VW sac
:pepebrain:
yea could be good maybe
FH sac might be actually the play
no way
and it takes long time to switch
288 mana per 4s
with int+motw
12s
882
Well thats pretty much extra seed
remember mana spring
etc
?
:peepohigh:
what?
are you denying warlocks get most dps from 1 haste rating?
pretty sure no one else wants 2x ring
spriest doesnt want 90 sp proc?
idk about that
did u guys sim it?
hyjal trash mb?
actually im missing kings
so its always extra seed every 12s
you have 164 hit in bt bis
including skull
hmmm
could chicken tank it
wearing 244 sr sounds shit
well even 174
thats like 3-4 epic pieces
why would demo lock tank?
you prio warlock tank on everything
well 3-4 pieces
unless mother is actually mega hard and need to farm epics for everyone
you can farm infinite sr first week
only matters if going for world firsts / server firsts
it works
tell non meles to jump if they have aggro
ban melees from jumping
and its super easy
ability
im doing bt on retail bros
heart of darknesses are looking pretty rare
dbm has autolog feature
just turn that on and youll always have logs
bt is looking real juicy
a lot of seed packs
yeah
haha
i kept my cloak
:pepehands:
runed stygian would be so good
runed stygian is good enough
https://i.nuuls.com/dXX83.png
loot from full BT clear on retail
only one trash epic dropped
and i think illidan is 7/5 loot table
normal items& weapons
well illidan and mother seemed to drop too many items
everything else was normal
but that could be 2.4 change or something
i think illidan dropping 2x weapons/nonweapons was in original tbc
on later patches
would explain drop rates on wowhead
nah they wont in classic
mages get toc+chronicle
i saw mages talking about it
toc+chronicle simmed better on arcanes
who else would take it
locks want 2 items
skull and ZD
!skull
locks literally want 2 items
skull and zergling staff
locks are and will hard carry
give them loot
i play good classes only
:peepohigh:
they are hard carrying
what do mages bring to raids? nothing
what happens next phase when mages fall off?
well locks are hardest class to play
big difference between pumpers & nonpumpers
what?
lock is unironically hardest dps spec to play
if you care about total dps
u guys baiting?
how is it not true?
and who knows anything about spriest
u guys seem to think haste is better stat than sp for spriests
keep projecting krymer
yap im seething dude
haste makes locks tap faster
and increases isb uptime
so mages&spriests get more dps
u sure?
we have to remember increased isb uptime is good for raid dps
nah fire mage is meme spec
mages stay arcane
isnt crit dagger just better for eles
mace maybe good for spriest/moonkin
(if you run moonkin)
anyway
locks only want 2 items
ZD&skull
4 piece is free
it is free
not really?
every decent guild just gave it to mages
mages passed on NK because they got t5 prio right?
:Pepeclown:
@Davos paladins were buffed a lot in later patches
they were way worse early on
biggest thing is no one did splits or had alts really
main tanks from vanilla were tauren male warriors
so they used tauren male warriors
pretty much every other discord
:Pepeclown:
@Blow just take the pvp mace it looks cool af
troll locks would be so good
life tap 1hp into berserking
imagine playing nudota
league was good like 15 years ago
s2-s3
sure why not
s2 jungle meta was great
it was actually fun to play
nah
im just a teamplayer
what?
my messages are deleted on fight club
so i doubt you can do that
oh so its photoshopped
nice
oh exactly what it was 2 years ago?
why?
you want to stay longer in hyjal?
longer in bt?
and way worse on aoe
100 dps
yea it is
100 dps is literally around 10% of spriests dps
https://kristoferhh.github.io/WarlockSimulatorTBC/
go check it yourself
its pretty easy
can you link the spriest sim so i can check out how much dps spriest gains from ZD on multi dot situation
@Blow
on aoe
100 dps is 100 dps
shorter the fight better ZD is on aoe
i simmed 150-210s
https://i.nuuls.com/Wr819.png
and thats 80% isb uptime
85% is realistic with decent rng next phase
i could have early on
but probably not
and atiesh isnt even enabled
but people really dont understand warlocks skipped whole t5 gear progression
we got what 50-60sp in total
i did more dps like 2 months ago with fire
and 0 t5 loots
than now
no im saying we get our first upgrades in next phase
https://i.nuuls.com/Nfdh7.png
@Blow can you guess which of these fights was with literal 0 t5 loot
and stormcaller
well it was the highest dps one
well i was fire
fire does more raid dps
but for some reason mages want to grief raid
dont give spriests solarian wand
thats hard grief
:zerglingstaff:
EP?
let me guess stam is 0 EP?
when spriests are always dying because of SWD
ofc :pepebrain:
Officer of <                 >
why is he using mag wand
progress failed again?
how much ahead were they
like 5 mins ahead
well t5 is pretty hard to speedrun
no buffs to remove all mechanics
1-2 locks shadow rest fire is optimal raid dps
well it is pretty much pure caster
warrior is brought for demo&sunder
we have ran 2 raids since day 1
2 vestments
🙂
its dogshit for melees
absolute dogshit
i think it reduces 300 or 200 before threat reductions
well its only good for locks
crits with it still do less threat than normal hits
(seed crits)
Aka chain wiping and waiting for lusts
Imagine
How do you even get to 60 hit, i cant get below 90
Haste pvp neck should come later too
Not in bt patch
Haste pvp necks were added in 2.3 iirc
How much honor is the neck
Holy fuck
Fucking blizz
Oh thats more doable
Only 20h of bgs
On how many mobs can one pala apply jow?
we better get haste gems in next phase
:peepohigh:
what about illidans sex slaves
will they be replaced by fruit bowls
whens t6 coming
zergling staff = lock prio
bro toc is mage bis p4
why would you ever give them ZD
mages want toc
spriests want mace
locks want ZD
need 2 locks per raid
:pepehands:
yes and enha personal dps will suck gigantic balls also
you still want 5 shamans
and ele isnt melee
you cant take 5 resto shamans
need to take eles or enhas
and more shamans is more shamans anyway
you wont be running 5 healers in swp
3-4 later on
and healers will be insane hps wise
healers scale pretty well with haste
better loot distribution
locks take haste cloak
other casters take crit cloak
and gearing healers only helps if it allows you to cut a healer
!zhardoom
!skull
will we get haste pvp ring in next phase too?
30 spell haste
vindicator's band of subjugation
30 haste
should be bis for seeding
well 2nd bis
"spell haste"
https://i.nuuls.com/pHos5.png
going to need like 30-40k honor if spell haste gear is out day 1
:peepohigh:
atleast its unique
:peepohigh:
neck is now 15k
:peepohigh:
what the fuck
oging to be even more next season
how much arena points do you get if you go lose 10 5s
:peepohigh:
:peepohigh:
if sunwell is hard you only bring locks anyway
so this argument doesnt work
ehh
will depend on comp
if you can get 12 locks muru is free
(if no spell pushback)
we will be running BT for a long time
toc/ZD is going to be DE eventually
especially if its 7/5 drop tables
well if your poopsocker will be running it still in swp
blizz milked t4 for how many resets?
they will milk BT as long as possible
its 1/5 most likely
2 bosses
you will de 50% of BT loot week 1
actually so much dogshit
toc literally is better than ZD for mages
yes?
check mage discords discussion about it
spellfire gloves is bis
on fire
and shoulders very good for seeding next phase
https://i.nuuls.com/OY8KV.png
hunters are ODing on copium
yep if hunter is good player he somehow gets aoe ability
female belf is bis
imagine being british
pretty sure ring & neck both will cost 15.3k
based on wowhead comments
kj is seedable too right?
you sim pure haste on yellow sockets, haste/sp on red sockets
blue is either 7sp or 5 haste i think
:Pepeclown:
sp does nothing when seeding
haste is always good
if ur parse monkey chain wiping on bosses you probably go sp
in every other case you go haste
im getting 50 dps difference
full haste vs sp
but its whatever
i did every socket optimally
orange in yellows on sp set, orange on reds in haste set
you can gem haste in blue stoo
forceful seaspray emerald
2sp bonus is worth it too
on swp gear
well locks have naturally the highest hp
especially once we get t6
so you shouldnt worry
It works dude
imagine goggles on bald female orc
:peepohigh:
@Xelrog what is pump?
being below locks?
just get quags proc and hellfire
INSANE DPS
equip quags+bowiz
proc both and hellfire
arcane is kino
ur using hildi sim?
it undervalues crit if using custom isb uptime
more crit more isb
more haste more isb
more sp = no change on isb
yea on fire destro crit isnt that good
if blizz fixes seed aoe cap
would be instantly best aoe
its pretty hard to aoe cap AE tho
need a lot of mobs or AP
we just need to mass report it when t6 ptr comes
and pray it gets fixed
can fit like 15
but hard to go more than that
12 is easy
imagine using 0 stam gear
we have had 2
from 2 raids running since week 1
hopefully we get haste gems next phase
so vestments wont even be bis
t6 chest is cooler anyway
not really
right now literally 20 people want red gems i think
so will be kinda yikes
everyone wont want haste gems
literally only locks want them over 12sp
dont go illidan head
no wings
channeled elements to non vestments locks
and then boomies/eles
channeled elements arent contested really
only moonkins/eles/spriests
and no one wants helm because its dogshit
dont go illidan head wtf
no wings
so locks got assfucked by vestments rng,okay now take this dogshit head
and other classes t6 legs are close to channeled elements anyway
no wings dude
and ryusei are you sure channeled elements is that good on other classes?
eles will want 2pc t4+2pct6 afaik
why wouldnt ele want illidan head?
it has a lot of crit
sure if ur tailor
sapph enchant problem tho
well it is
no wings
:peepohigh:
ofc you can
u need 2 blue gems
well that depends
mages should go for toc+chronicle
ele should go for dagger+shield
toc+chronicle is better for them in p4
30 dps better iirc
some guy was simming in their discord
they lose hit from trinket slot or something
idk whatelse
and a lot of mage bis lists have skull
:Pepeclown:
anyway
mages take toc+chronicle
locks take ZD
if they want something
they add innervates or lower fight duration
well it is if you go check their sims
ZD barely wins even in short fights
and TOC gets ahead in longer fights
just their google doc
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RVUhrf47O1x6xXvK_qFtpilaB7NHkNmZutzwdsHbGRM/edit#gid=0
okay and what about icon+scb
where toc+chronicle is just better
dont look at skull sims
yeah
toc+chronicle literally being same as ZD
doesnt mean mages take ZD
it means they take toc+chronicle
mage discord is wrong?
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RVUhrf47O1x6xXvK_qFtpilaB7NHkNmZutzwdsHbGRM/edit#gid=0
and on aoe ZD is better for locks
mages get way more from crit&sp on aoe
@Jujutsu so mages are always aoe capped and dont have extra crit multi ?
did i say haste is better?
no i said crit+sp is better for mages on aoe
no
i said crit+sp is better stat for mages on aoe
https://i.nuuls.com/7Z_g-.png
as you can see from my messages
where did i imply it?
can you show
yeah
because sp is literally dead stat for us half of the time
and dont have extra crit dmg on seed crits
yeah it makes crit better
but haste is best for locks
sure maybe ( if you dont hit 1s gcd cap)
but crit is better for mages
so ur saying crit isnt more valuable for mages?
especially next phase with haste trinket
than for locks
@Jujutsu so mages will use 30 haste pvp ring right
and haste pvp neck is bis probably right?
@Jujutsu if haste is so superior stat for mages especially on aoe
surely they will use those items?
https://i.nuuls.com/OTklK.png
im thinking ZD case is closed now
well
i have no idea who this guy is
could be some 140 iq mage theorycrafter
or some random
but if mages cant even agree if toc is bis
should u give it to them over locks?
mages say zd isnt bis
zd isnt bis
our atiesh lock got fang few weeks ago
everyone else had it
trash farmimg hyjal :Pepeclown:
idk about that
hyjal drops dogshit epics
really want to farm BT
well pretty efficiently
healer cloak is easy
it helps loot distribution
mages/eles/moonkins take crit cloak
we take healer cloak
just make different macros for mana pot + seed and mana pot + shadow bolt
yeah but ur going to have small gap
oh looks like arc/fire is pretty good?
and fire locks are pretty good too?
what do you mean zd only?
dagger+shield is very good for eles
and has shitload of armor
best loot distribution is: locks ZD, mages/pala toc+chronicle + ele dagger+shield + moonkin/spriest mace/dagger
13 dps?
what are they doing
its 20-30 dps
why would lock somehow get less dps from ZD if using 2x haste rings
thats not how locks work
well you gotta remember aoe
why didnt you do it hildi
we could solve the ZD issue
t4 pieces are dog
t5 pieces are good
well 4pc t5 isnt that bad on afflilock
but 2pc t4 and actual good offpieces should be bis
curse everything with more than 150k hp
but you should have some coe help on seed packs
unless running only 2 locks
well seed gcd is 13k
but you cant instantly seed because of aggro anyway
month long ptr means you get to raid t6
most people are quite literally done with t5
i just want to know if haste gems are in
:peepohigh:
t6 ptr now plz
no problem
have arc/fire and cast fire spells
straight up going 4pc t5 should be good on demo
vestments offpiece
a lot of stats and you cast corruption + sb
you should never go oom in heroics
do you tap to full mana out of combat?
p4 has pantaloons
haste chest too
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/58fCBCLATxALzvuEyQDW2i
p4 seeding set looking real juicy
assuming no haste gems
priests are based ?
yeah locks are supposed to be degens
worth 6k? no imo
quags will be pretty close eventually in t6
and you will only use motc on bosses really
trash in bt is mostly humanoids
not that motc would be good on seed trash anyway
even at 2.9k phylactery seems to win
motc 10 dps better
hildi sim doesnt give motc just flat 85 sp right
doesnt boost life tap in sim?
if motc is just flat 85 sp , its over valued
yeah i think motc doesnt work correctly in hildi sim
mag & archimonde?
👀
its friday in finland guys
most mods are mages
:peepohigh:
make the chicken tank illidan
:pepebrain:
imagine seeing vestments drop
:peepohigh:
what the actual fuck blizzard
personal dps maybe
crit cloak is better for most classes
haste cloak only good for locks imo
guys s2 was after BT release in original tbc
and somehow we got s2 gear with p2 release
we will be getting s3 haste items most likely
you should just bite the bullet and take haste cloak
so other classes can take the crit cloak
@Caesar yes but if locks dont take haste cloak
literally every casters going to want same cloak
expect spriest
wdym xelrog
haste cloak is pretty much free
healers dont need it
no?
most dps classes think they want it
when really only lock wants the haste cloak
as a mage i would always go for crit cloak
ele too
spriest the shadow dmg cloak
more spriests you have less dps they do
more than 1 is HARD GRIEF
@Scanlawn mages dont understand their aoe scales from sp & crit?
when locks only way to scale aoe is haste
they do but you actually get something from sp and more from crit on aoe @Scanlawn
wheres ur aoe sim btw
@Scanlawn ok so you want to take haste cloak because? crit cloak is literally just as good on ST
when on locks haste is always bis
when im saying mages dont want haste cloak?
when infact they dont want it
yes for locks
for other classes? no
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RVUhrf47O1x6xXvK_qFtpilaB7NHkNmZutzwdsHbGRM/edit#gid=0
is it?
@Kristofer did you fix the motc? or is it working correctly
not really
in full t6 bis its pretty much same as quags
and unlucky proc on curse wont cuck you
how many locks you run?
if running 3 locks
all in boomi+ele grp
should never have affli
why dont mages just frostbolt?
so tell them to press coe/cor
and quit
its simply not worth it
affli is really only good in heavy caster stacks
progress uses affli in 2x pala+resto druid grp on trash
very good in that situation imo
with 5 locks affli is worth it
but you should really have atleast sp totem
wdym
if you have warrior soaking
he can apply debuff
what
warrior tank is best soaker if you run one
wait someone is running no isb fire spec?
in this phase?
:Pepeclown:
it was a meme in p1
its hard grief this phase
nice guild
:Pepeclown:
everything is easy to 99 if you dont speedrun
hyjal will be fun
non warlocks / mages will be seething hard
movement doesnt affect immolate at all
go normal spec
cast immolate 2nd global
or if you have threat problems (leo)
well that only matters if you have fishes
if using boiled water strat you can stay in water for extra 1s no problem
just cast it 2nd global
and if you have threat problems
and its always dps up
pretty sure its more dmg and more crit chance
https://tbc.wowhead.com/spell=38715/fire-vulnerability
its this spell
effect doesnt say anything about increased crit chance
but it feels like you crit more
@Occupied well if hes using different gear set he probably has higher crit chance
and i think bosses have crit suppression
could be
just remember it from vanilla
https://i.nuuls.com/Qh8Ks.png
:peepohigh:
seed direct hit never crits
so its a lot of free crit
?
:peepohigh:
it should proc it
would be decentish if it works exactly how we want
good / probably bis for seeding
for st its not good
thats some good shit
even in next phase should be shadow tbh
yeah mages staying arcane is the play
they take 0 loot
and pump (on trash)
no skull, no locks
no ZD, no cor
not going for healer cloak is grief
you will never see ~10 council cloaks drop
someone has to take healer cloaks
and its best for locks
skull,zd,haste cloak all uncontested
sure they will
and lose to warlock stack
unlucky go next expansion
hunters?
:Pepeclown:
what
every guild runs cor
because its more raid dps
yea one lock should always do isb
either dmg curse destro or affli
on seed packs every lock should coe/cor
in normal packs just coe everything as affli
dont coe murlocs
they have 70k hp
only coe mobs with +150k hp
he could be seeding
thats 13k / global
and even if hes singletargeting
global is around 4-5k
and actually makes the boss die faster
well he still shouldnt coe murlocs
coeing few murlocs just griefs raid dps
you want them to die at same time
coe bypasses aoe cap
its always +10% dmg
yea but its still 10%
it works the same way
mob takes 10% more dmg
it will die 10% faster than non coe mobs
who cares about retail logs
literally press correct rotation and you get 99
@Xelrog we dont know what prismatic shield we are getting
it will be most likely prenerf one
if its prenerf you switch between shadow/fire every 15s
anyone have expression for checking parries?
is dmf even out week 1
we should be more interested in crit card
it could be very good for seeding
but most likely its useless
because blizz hates locks
yeah it probably wont work on seed but it could
you tap walk
if healer mana is "important" you run +8 locks right?
well then healer mana isnt important
arcane mage is literally easiest class/spec in whole game
like what
press more AE?
warlock is unironically hardest class to play optimally when going fast
well im very sure ur dogshit then
lock is literally the only class that needs to do gear swaps
to do good dps
yeah for most classes skill doesnt matter at all
well it is harder than not managing gear sets
it is harder than not to itemrack
and for locks its massive difference
well even if they try
they just dont have aoe
tk depends
if you do sheeps and shit
hard griefs locks and benefits hunters
VR packs maybe
but its mostly single target or 6 mob packs
imagine playing physical dps
yeah bro
im sure glaive furies will beat locks
well ur always going to run atleast 2 locks
and if you run 2
can run 4
people just underestimate how hard locks scale
p3 has a lot of haste gear
and t6 set bonus is the biggest dps upgrade
in what world do locks do "meh dmg"
did it trigger me?
locks dps didnt increase at all p1-p2
threat wont be a problem
and if it will be raid will have 0 furies
prot paladin cant tank mother i think
and essence mb
nah
you put them in prot pala/healer grp
prot pala only wants sp totem
they can tank stuff now just fine
next phase they get insane
what threat group?
healer grp has sp totem
well resto can run t4 2pc
and use eye of the night if pala is mting
only reason to run eles is warlocks
who cares whats bis
mages dont have ele in optimal raid grp
why would you give it to mages
its wasted on them half of the time
not really
@ved whats 70+30
mages got too cocky
:pepe_happy:
ryusei mages wont get another 2pc t5 in this expansion
even if you feed them infinite innervates, they wont be doing that much more dps
arc/fire is always worth it
fire is 150 dps more than shadow on coe/cor locks
yea fury gets so much from lust with no CDs up
just gotta cut the mage grp
but really should only do that next phase
you dont need to run any mages next phase
one arc/fire will be meta probably yeah
will be nice for mother if its prenerf prismatic shield
gearing 12 locks isnt hard at all
you run 3 raids
1-2 months and every lock has everything they want
3 raids isnt hard at all
if you want to do melee stacks, you need to do +6 BT splits
with warlock stack 4 could be doable
higher raid dmg doesnt matter really
i dont think anything will be more raid dmg than tanking VR pounding
brown griefing
:pepehands:
no reason to switch to shadow on solarian trash
its all aoe capped
real chads dont have vestments
and just wait for channeled elements
big brains have locks rdy for next phase
mages hard peaked already
:Pepeclown:
fury will pump
:Pepeclown:
hf switching elixir of demonslaying / flask every pack
+ scrolls
+ haste pots
meanwhile lock pops 30g flask
few mana pots
and is top dps
flask prices will go down next phase
flame cap is like 2g bro
ofc it is
even though mages thought 100% uptime on 150 haste is bad
its not
pala will do a lot of more threat next phase
fetish+divination both are shit
prism is best threat reduction trinket
@Skycrab not many
ghost room, some mother trash mobs
even now theres no threat problem if conc ticks
will be even less next phase
u have 1.5s to click right mob
if u miss one
unlucky
press seed
its not?
you tell one lock to coe cross+moon on seed packs
etc
how hard is it?=
never, but it will probably get replaced with haste gear in p4
in p4
:peepohigh:
not swp
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/3F8vKSWLtAjwufehLH82kT
insane seed set
assuming no haste gems ofc
?
toc+chronicle is better for mages
especially in p4
going for toc is griefing
take ZD
:peepohigh:
mages take crit cloak
and locks just have to take healer cloak
unlucky
nah
mages actually use the hit from toc+chronicle in p4 i think
because they use hxh
and they cast more fillers probably
so hit is always useful
mages stay arcane whole expansion
taking 0 swp loot ofc
@Jujutsu it is tho
yes it is?
guy in mage discord simmed it
it is
every lock should go for ZD+skull+healer cloak
to ease loot distribution
wow release talents were great
200% weapon dmg mortal strike
Catabolt is a meme
Immo is insane 2nd global
Tbc som would be so good
Only locks in raids
Yeah bro 2x hp just stack arcane mages
Well if haste gems are in, channeled elements are bis
But wouldnt take them if i had vestments
Shoulders bis offpiece for seeding if no haste gems
But a lot of people are engi
So its like 2-3k to level tailoring and relvl engi
Will do it tho
Its not pog for mages tho
Its not, do mages have aoe sim yet?
Mages like never aoe cap, crit is strong
Haste is lock prio
It is?
No shit but sp doesnt
Fact is mages benefit more from sp&crit on aoe than locks
So? Locks take haste gear
Mages take crit&sp
Yes
Affli loses a lot of value next phase
People will go full destro at any number of casters
affli just scales like dogshit
@Majus
destro simply outscales the 3% dmg
affli brings
making hyjal trash timegated would be blizzards biggest mistake with classic
and they have made many mistakes
no?
and chill guys
shadow will be meta next phase
dmg difference between fire/shadow is literal 50 dps
illidan has fire unfriendly mobs
some other boss has fire res
and at 85% isb uptime difference is 30 dps
if you dark rune its literal same
85% next phase is very realistic
with any number of locks
it is tho
very doable with 4
if they all are in ele grp
wdym
75% is low roll atm
https://maarslet.github.io/DebuffCheck/
74% was lowest isb uptime
with 3 locks
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/AGNzJYF7bX8jmRCW#boss=-3&difficulty=0
in my last ssc
you used debuff checker?
use debuff checker bro
its the only way to check isb uptime
isb stack checker
haste does impact isb
but not a lot
it counts the shadow bolt hits which were affected by isb
= ISB UPTIME
85% last VR
with 3 locks
ofc if we run 3 locks
its mainly about gearing
you dont put prot pally in spriest grp
unless you only run 4 shamans
is someone wanding
post your logs
probably someone wanding
are u guys casting shadow bolt?
2 spriests?
that explains it
dont run 2 spriests kids
https://i.nuuls.com/vH8M6.png
tell people to NOT WAND
https://maarslet.github.io/DebuffCheck/
debuff thing doesnt work correctly
you pretty much never drop any debuffs
unless you run 12 locks and everyone is immolating+dooming
why use speed zanza?
overclock used speed zanza whole raid?
or what
:peepohigh:
imagine seeing vestments drop
buffed?
ur using spellfire?
mages are hardcore coping
nah
they go arcane and take t6 legs
toc+chronicle
and thats it
why would anyone want mages to go fire?
dont let them
they just want to steal all the lock loot
ofc because he wants to steal loot
locks easy to replace?
:Pepeclown:
this is almost sad
anyone remember how cocky hunters were p1?
fire badge OH
probably not
i just use knapsack
because manual doesnt drop
nightbane OH doesnt drop
10 mechas is enough for me
pvp neck isnt that good for bosses
bis for seeding tho
yeah very good
and bis stamina
fire neck is 14 more sp
Yeah haste probably better
spellthread better tho if you need hit
than haste neck
you will tho
in bis setup
are u ally?
thats not bis
ZD is bis
its not even close
https://i.nuuls.com/Wv5TM.png
exactly 164 hit
realistic bis imo
idk if sp/crit is better
maybe it is
4sp
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=31054/mantle-of-the-malefic
it is 4sp tho
yea pyrestone crit/sp probaly better in helm/shoulders
if haste gems are in you go yellow 10 haste on everything
no you use haste
because its better when seeding
theres like 0 red sockets in p3
1sp vs 5 crit
wrong xelrog
no one wants haste belt
no they dont
they want noose
even lock wants noose
but should take haste belt
mages think they want wrap
they dont
why would boomi ever want haste belt over noose
theres no way its bis for them over noose
another plate chest+leather shoulders reset
:peepohigh:
its almost fun
hardest part of speedrun done
lurker+hydross
:pepebrain:
pogress got this?
@Blow no fucking way
1.6k ?
are u trolling
this is why you dont give haste gear to spriests kids
i thought they would atleast break 2k
now do 0 haste set
:peepohigh:
@Blow post full sp set bro
:peepohigh:
@Blow can you post that full sp set
you posted full haste setup
surely you tested full sp one too?
well i for sure hope they dont work
1.6k with that gear doesnt sound good at all
mages are insane
i dont understand whats their problem
arc/fire is just better spec
how is requiring less support somehow less fun
every time spriests suicide with death they coom
actual griefers
how much do you get from netherdrake dailies
who cares about mount
everyone is going to get anyway
and imagine even having 5k flying
bro thats useless
30s ?
yeah bro lets take 10s break before pull
so i can get 80sp for 30s
@Occupied ur the belf rogue?
its 30s
i wouldnt call it good
Its pretty much never negative
Pendant is decent if no spriest
It is decent
Its 40 int bro
Mages take t6 legs, toc+chronicle
Enjoy
For me its scb+pipe
On aoe tlc+quags
Yes
Its not tho
Mages think IV is insane and quags dog?
Actual idiots
IV is dogshit and quags is insane
45s cd vs 3 mins
Quags just works
No extra button presses
Mages think arc/frost is good
Dont even try
Mages think requiring more support is better than requiring less support and bringing massive raid debuff
Actual 0 iq idiots
Fire lock is more raid dps tho
Bro
Is that why every top guild is running arc/fire
Arc/fire isnt dogshit personal
Thats mage lies
Best caster playing arc/fire? Wonder why
Loot distribution, locks take haste cloak and other casters crit cloak
ZA cloak is worse
Illidan cloak is bis until swp
Arc/fire doesnt feel worse to play
Its not lowering yourvdps
Mage doesnt have infinite mana
Motc is bis until full p3 bis
In full bis quags is equal
0 fillers in 47 ssc?
Thats pretty good
Mages gain way less on st
They want it for aoe but its better for locks on both aoe & st
Realistic horde set is 164 hit
!skull
Why should there be
Warlock is pretty simple class
No haste cap or any breakpoints
How are mages hitcapped
Unless they go for toc+chronicle
And gear gives like 0
T6 legs is a lot of hit and they are going for toc+oh anyway
Wdyn
Only noose is contested and you rly should pass on thst
Everything else is lock loot
Vestments is a trap
Go for channeled elements
I have killed like 15 saw vestments on first kill
Been #1 after that
Glaive same drop chance as alar mount
OH NO NO NO NO
4% i think
4-6
Alar is 5% right
Guild seed loot IDs
Blizzards greatest trick
T5 is pretty good too
shield + healer trinket
OH NO NO NO NO
or even worse
drops fucking glaives
i have accepted im never getting vestments
hydross chest+t5
is pretty good too
hydross on trash
t5 on bosses
channeled elements
like 1-2 dps worse than vestments setup
if haste gems arent in
and we thought CSD was BT
no they should be bt
:peepohigh:
stop spreading mage propaganda
!bis
seed sapper hellfire is death unless you get bop
it is tho
2-3 globals on seed packs
on highest hp mobs
nah
one lock on cor rest coe
unless you run like 8 locks
you use 2-3 globals max on cor
seed is 13k
no way cor does 13k
u guys dont melee weave?
:peepohigh:
prism is best threat reduction trinket
question is do you need any
ofc
no 30s CD on prism
it just works
quags/tlc
im not sure which is better
TLC is insane on mage
probably decent on lock
pass sextant for mages tbh
assuming they switch trinkets
why wouldnt they want sextant
actual OMEGA bis
mages are pretty much never aoe capped
but sextant is insane sp value too
tlc is omega bis on mage
its going to be bis whole game on aoe
bro
ele deals literally the same dps if they have nexus key
actual 0 scaling on that class
ES is on tanks guys
its on tanks
its heal + threat
if you need ES as warlock
ur shit
its just free healing+threat
no reason to not use it on tanks
no
it should be on tanks
its irrelevant until its not
parse brains
imagine waiting for lust in t5
som has like 3 guilds
1 server
ptr coming?
🙏
retri using NF in caster stack
probably worth it right
would be nice if it eats ISB
very strong argument for fire
or allow them to use it
and go fire
shouldnt run affli next phase
full meme
well doesnt matter
some people probably like to run frost mage
5%?
affli is like 700 dps behind next phase
hildi sim
imp malediction going to bring 600 dps in normal comp?
bro
i dont think casters are doing 20k raid dps in normal comps
well mage/warlock/moonkin atleast
wouldnt call that normal tbh
especially next phase
3 locks+ boomkin/lock + 1 mage + shadow
yes most raids have more than 1 mage
now
no idea hard to say how good mages will perform
sure they will
aoe too if seed bug is fixed
because we didnt get any upgrades this phase?
or first phase
bro
illidan is like 10 min atleast
first night kill no ptr?
doubt that
@Xelrog vashj is easy tho
:Pepeclown:
teron will be hardest boss ingame
:Pepeclown:
@Nullandvoid no point is its 820 sp
just rocket boots
FA isnt even a mechanic
its not always 3 person
FA can target totems etc
based on my research (wowhead comments) it can
🙏
PLEASE BE PTR
its up boys
https://i.nuuls.com/0xfEq.jpeg
up boys
spell haste gem in atm
https://i.nuuls.com/rsETb.png
mage bros...
fury bros...
https://i.nuuls.com/l-DQo.png
haste neck in
https://i.nuuls.com/hqn7C.png
trinket is in too
is it supposed to be
https://i.nuuls.com/tVzqY.png
not for locks
battlemaster / skull bis i think
quags when skull isnt up
cursing cucks quag hard
spell haste gems better stay in
🔫
yap
ill go test aoe cap
maybe they fixed it
dr boom is easiest way to test right?
https://i.nuuls.com/xX6qx.png
i think its still bugged
@Lite was in hyjal
yeah
seed bug is still in
t6 on 24tth would be content
haste gems should be in tho
:peepohigh:
@Est nmeed to be in grp
@Aloysius seed is still bugged
:peepohigh:
:peepohigh:
u got vestments now?
OH NO NO NO NO
haste gems are in too atm
🙂
hopefully it stays in
@Drikkink haste gems arent either
time to start that seed report campaign bros
:peepohigh:
REMINDER TO REPORT SEED BUG
:peepohigh:
you will be using it alot unless you kill every mob perfectly at same time
oblivion set is only good for trash bro
its decent-ish
probably worst haste piece you could ever get
and pretty sure battlemaster shouldnt even be in
neck & ring*
haste neck should be in
battlemaster shouldnt
haste gems should be in
@Ryusei how :peepohigh:
i wasted 0 globals and got 29.98s
no novas?
ping affects it?
my no nova was slower
:peepohigh:
i wasted 0 globals,no gaps
and got 29s
something affects it
report SEED BUG
REPORT SEED BUG
@BergMichel skull is lock only item, ZD is lock prio
:peepohigh:
reckless is honored too
atleast on wowhead
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=35762/design-reckless-pyrestone#teaches-recipe
honored scale
:peepohigh:
its scaled sand rep
just makes sense to add it asap
we are playing on 2.4.3
https://i.nuuls.com/IuAup.png
whats wrong with mages
@drives why does it show its scaled sand on wowhead?
says phase 3 too
no im not
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=35762/design-reckless-pyrestone#teaches-recipe
bro open my link
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=35762/design-reckless-pyrestone#teaches-recipe
yeah its both just like other haste gems
pvp ring is in right
haste one
didnt check
haste neck is for trash
you dont
you use spellthread on bosses
top 2 is shadow
they lost by 13s
:pepel
would have won with fire locks
OH NO NO NO
did hildi change sim
elements simmed better earlier
@Ryusei hildi changed the sim
:peepohigh:
@Kristofer do you have vestments?
it was like 0-1 dps difference
does sim value crit more now?
well haste gems should be in
haste neck should be in
pvp trinket is worst possible haste piece ingame
its still decent for seeding tho
neck is pretty good imo for seeding
haste neck probably better than verdant tbh
@Healspls its equal with t5 bis
haste neck vs KT neck on st
you need RoS hit in bis setup
yeah for bosses
barely any demons on trash
a lot of orcs
elementals
in BT
hyjal is seed trash mostly anyway
i meant barely any demon trash mobs
@Cobalt314 hildi made crit better then
:peepohigh:
better panic sell everything before people get to mother
if its actually hard
you cant kill it with greens
if you dont use hit , maybe
but you use the hit
bro
hildi bricked the sim
made crit more valuable or something
@gremmer🐢 well haste gear and channeled elements simmed better earlier
could be wrong tho ofc
earlier channeled elements was better with haste gems
now vestments is better again
no idea
ZD still 30 dps better
wait actually ZD is only 10 dps better now
should we try to get arcanite dragonling fixed too
:peepohigh:
and chicken isnt?
nice one blizzard
crusade is dog
this boss looking real hard
they have to click?
dogshit loot
OH NO NO NO
imagine seeing that shit drop
locks hard carrying
bosses are never problem
trash is hard part
🙏
lets pray for melee unfriendly mechanics
melee cant hit dragons oh no no no
just forget it exists
use t5
cba
ill wait until import is working
pala doing insane threat
its over bear bros...
did they add male sex slaves to illidans room
wait are they actually redeeming sylvanas?
instead of just killing her off
supremus is the fire resistance boss right
supposed to have fire res?
just 4 stack council and seed
dont worry people will kill illidan before demon phase
melees wont have 50% uptime
dogshit loot again
yeah bro
mother will be hard
panic buy SR
3.9m hp will be the wall
dec 24 would be kino
hope so
mass report GAMEBREAKING seed bug
ohh this mob is looking melee friendly
we need to check out other sims
:peepohigh:
10 haste is way better for aoe
https://i.nuuls.com/p0LE5.png
not looking good
feels post nerf
those shadows had like 10k hp
what is this boss
easier than post nerf gruul
https://i.nuuls.com/ZaT68.png
its over
varbane is live?
varbane ptr is best content
its about ping
or something else
bro
its something
minigame needs spell queue
in red sockets
12 hyjal waves
god please
🙏
@Zuzandir doesnt matter, epic gems are same
Wait they nerf everything in t5?
:Pepeclown:
bro
solarian drops bis wand
t5 will drop more loot too right
if tis nerfed
i mean 3x offpieces etc
from solarian n shit
pretty sure you get 3 items from solarian on 2.4
and other non tier bosses too
@Crix was mother easy?
sub numbers low probably
endwalker right?
they missed technicians
84k -> 14k
yeah ssc techinicians
the technicians on lurker trash
reminder to report seed bug
:peepohigh:
hopefully we get prenerf hyjal
:peepohigh:
12 waves
whole BT feels post nerf
no way trash mobs had that low hp
compared to t5
you can
you just dont take points in immo
no they wont
they go arc/fire if anything
hildi sim doesnt have haste ring?
oh was in p5
split raiding t5
oh no nono
does hildi sim have aoe cap?
really?
:Pepeclown:
i wonder who checked them out 1 min after ptr was out
reception for haste gem has been positive so far
no reason to remove them
no it wasnt
reddit was complaining
@[Hun] Lepto it is blizzlike we are on 2.4.3
well it is a joke atm
killable with 0 res
1k -> 2k -> 3k
atm
which is post nerf
150 with greens just makes the fight harder
actual gear like
neck
and locks can easily run 0 SR
no problem
it was assumed haste gems arent in
bis list isnt fixed
it was bis on sim earlier
then hildi changed something
channeled will be better for total dps for sure
on st sp gems seem to better anyway
sure if you can get haste gems on oblivion set, but thats not going to happen for most people
p4
if not p3
you use ZA / badge haste gear
every slot has haste piece pretty much
agreed we should go back to feelscrafting
i was right about everything anyway
so does spriest sim work now
how much ahead is the full sp setup
over haste shit
locks dont need anarethon's noose
we can use hit from bob
even as ally
just switch spellthread to haste neck
and this is assuming we get haste gems
if no haste gem use haste belt
could be removed still but i doubt it
@thomasp1717 on aoe too?
sim has aoe right
And i really doubt that full sp is 50 dps behind haste setups
if haste is so good for spriests surely you dont even use sp gems?
mages getting way too cocky
skull lock only item
naaru lock prio
2nd lust is going to locks too
ZD too
mages peaked in t5
int scroll is 1g
no i didnt
i said locks get 0 upgrades in t5
spellfire is equal
i was redpilling mages recently
@OuiS affli is full meme spec in t6
it doesnt tho
lock shouldnt solo coe seed packs
you have to wait for threat 6 globals?
you run pala tank right
seed is 3/4th global
if you die you die
seeding skull is omega based tho
no?
its the best play
skull dies slower = whole raid does more dps
?
more mobs = more aoe dps
if you kill skull quickly thats one less mob
most of the time skull is just random target
yeah bro doing more dps is griefing
:peepohigh:
what debuffs
misery / coe should be up on everything
its not personal gain?
its raid dps gain
to split dmg
@jpaint misery should be on everything, coe should be on everything
shadow vulne wont be up fast if priest is playing correctly
technicians are 80k hp mobs
personally i seed off them
so they die slower
in most packs yeah
targets that will die fastest
and technicians usually have shit threat
no one is going to speedrun 2.5
its 1 month long meme partition
no reason to speedrun
!zd
@jpaint false
shadow is better
we are talking about 20 dps difference in t6 bis
shadow vs fire
shadow is straight up better
at 85% isb uptime shadow is literally same as fire
@jpaint yes
https://i.nuuls.com/JPAm6.png
https://i.nuuls.com/DwDGW.png
idk maybe i missed some debuffs
but i doubt that
okay
:Pepeclown:
85% is realistic
80% is normal
losing spriest is way bigger
well its a realistic argument
but it favors fire
because spriests are fucking floor pov dogs
suiciding with swd
fire has : 15% from mage +5% from spriest
shadow lock has: 15% from spriest
losing spriest as shadow is way bigger loss
always SS spriest
you go full haste + 2 blue gems
because haste scales aoe
bros
fire is literally same dps as shadow on hildi sim
its over.
doesnt require switches or anything
ofc it does
not even close
not having ele is realistic next phase
meta is going to replacing mages with locks
but they just use toc+chronicle its not a big deal
in optimal comp?
doubt it
int scroll is 1g
:peepohigh:
@Hildi can you add int scroll to sim?
skull + zergling staff + ring + cloak
no mages means healers have spriest
infinite mana basically
not in a speedrun
i think 3 healing BT is possible if healers have spriests
can you summon inside raid in ptr btw
fucking blizzard
actually easiest qol change ever
yea
i know
but that was added in tbc actually
they only want to go fire for loot
mages stay arcane.
are waves spawning instantly in hyjal btw
thank god
thing is
if arcane doesnt outperform locks actual 0 reason to bring mages
(in optimal comp)
yeah we are working on getting seed bug fixed
swp is our powerspike imo
!seedbug
hunter pets dont get anything from arp
its over
whats our cope for instantly spawning hyjal trash fellow mage gamers
mages regen mana while spamming ae?
actually better class than i thought
no it doesnt
using mara dagger on mage is grief
they are like never aoe capped
fire doesnt need ele
what are you smoking
not even lock needs ele
more crit mage gets less mana support it needs
bro ur over estimating how good destro pot is
yeah if arcane mage doesnt perform you switch to int scrolls
they want to use flame caps for sure
flame cap is insane
arcane scales with op t5 set bonus
mage only needs spriest
well 8 waves of hyjal trash
if ur playing optimally its basically in combat whole 8 packs
mage ooms only if they play dogshit spec(arc/frost)
chads play arc/fire
@KilLogic pretty sure you can push into spawn point
havent ptred no
@KilLogic what about the ally camp
i think they insta spawn in ally camp
fuck tongues
could they push t6 out next week
seems bug free
prenerf KT was great
2x hp on adds and MC bug
trash feels very weak
compared to t5
doesnt matter glaives are never going to drop
sure thing buddy
yap yap
glaives is pretty much same drop chance as bindings
and we did MC from week 1
when is it happening
im not raid leader
i just know everything
we need shaman cucks
:peepohigh:
why would you need to ptr t6 5 days
its t4 difficulty lvl
bro you clear day 1 with 0 ptr
its actual free content
reminder to report seed bug on PTR
:peepohigh:
no crafted shit on ptr?
engi goggles , blasting items?
can blizz just fucking fix import
:peepohigh:
tfw my gear is better on real servers than i can get on ptr
:peepohigh:
vestments is still bis on st
But elements way better on total dps
yeah but channeled elements setup has 2 more sockets
only non vestment locks
ptr doesnt have bloodthistle
:peepohigh:
my ptr character is belf
im bald female orc in real game
:peepohigh:
@Mayhem bigger than for non vestment locks?
ur high
mages want t6 legs
https://i.nuuls.com/I7VQQ.png
rdy to pump
need some NA andy to smuggle me some oils and bloodthistles
:peepohigh:
nah im a pumper
btw whats the optimal coe rank to use
r5 is 260
r1 is 100 mana
massive difference
!skull
this is good enough
atiesh is worse than ZD tho
and mages are replaced by int scrolls
they will probably remove haste gems
:pepehands:
and wont fix seed bug
:pepehands:
!seedbug
!seedbug
:peepohigh:
just report it before servers go down
:peepohigh:
poster was wrong about oblivion
its not irrelevant unless mobs die exactly at same time
not really
hxh sliver better for most casters probably
locks want skull+sliver

:peepohigh:
ofc furies are reporting everything
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/in-development/burning-crusade-classic-253-ptr/262
someone should make a post about seed here
:peepohigh:
!skull
well i cant
i dont have na character
ur going to get 800 dps from imp coe in balanced comp?
it is based on sims tho
affli is like 2.1k
destro 2.9k
on sim
people cleared everything
0 bugs
no reason to keep it up really
they gotta remove haste gems, and keep the seed bug ingame
everything to cuck locks
???
next phase its quag+skull
nah?
2 globals curse
because its dps up?
coe bypasses aoe cap
you have every lock put up coe
or cor
like 14k
:Pepeclown:
more haste = good
more sp = good
haste on aoe = OMEGA GOOD
sp on aoe = OMEGA DOGSHIT
haste could get you also one extra cast
bro
illidan not looking very fury friendly
roll lock
wdym
its the ultimate pump class
lock actually THE pumper class
blm?
nothing like tbc lock
:Pepeclown:
its a clown world
they wont fix seed bug
they remove haste gems
dont change tuning
enjoy
?
women work after birth
do americans really ???
DOUBLE IT
2x everything
no we need to show the world int scroll is just as good
concubines had like 14k hp
no way its prenerf
did you know incubus are rapists
:peepohigh:
no wonder blizz added them
did anyone test did they add extra loot drops to t5 content
:Pepeclown:
well no
okay so how good is haste for spriests on that sim
:peepohigh:
wdym almost as good
t5 chest is bis
dkp?
:Pepeclown:
skull will kill every dkp guild
no?
green parsing lock > pumper mage
!skull
any spriest simmers here
how much dps do spriests get from skull+zd
3
thats pretty nice
zd like 5?
seacaller is the most contested item
actually probably the only contested item locks want
ofc
pass on noose
take haste belt or bob with haste gems
haste belt +bob with oranges/sp reds is probably the play
use bob on bosses
haste belt is for trash
wait so
none of the loot is contested?
not really
non vestment locks,moonkins,ele??,spriest
idk if moonkins / eles rly want channeled elements
or if theres better offpiece
no
no wings
no wings no wear
leather boots are actually good
looks like boots are free
no you never give eles cloth boots bro
then you de leather boots
not really
unless they mt
:peepohigh:
are u guys assuming haste gems arent in
10 haste is better for total
give oranges to meme classes if they want them
you can gem oblivion with haste gems
what do you mean scuffed distribution?
only locks/mages want yellows
lmao
melees are way behind on yellow prio
way way behind
if haste gems are in
:peepohigh:
wrong way to look at haste
another week another no vestments
:peepohigh:
seen 1 vestments
:peepohigh:
week 1
not a single one after that
havent seen like any belts either
its always heal ring/heal shoulders/trinket/plate chest
why?
trash is nerfed
go and pump
takes 5 min
KT doesnt even drop anything
solarian is worth more
fire is dead after this phase
its over
because shadow catches up
why would you bother with sac switches
when shadow does as much dps
and doesnt require a mage in raid
im simming t6 bis and its equal
and this is personal only
raid dps wont be even close
which is good news
mages are replaceable by int scroll now
2/3 healers
2 in swp and 3 in t6 probably
you run 2 healers in swp
3 in t6 if they dont buff it
yea
was pserver meta
maybe 3 heal in pservers
but its classic
there is but healers pump with haste
https://i.nuuls.com/qkxJl.png
and people say 85% isnt realistic
:peepohigh:
that was my raid
and 4 locks+ele
more crit/haste/more locks = more isb
well haste helps
less impact from spriest
same with more locks
by other locks
if no haste gems next phase
isb uptime gonna skyrocket
paladin tanks it
time to bring shadow weaving back?
:Pepeclown:
people run dreamstate
why not shadow weaving
thats scuffed
only 2/3 misery
if you could get ids+3/3 misery
would be actually good spec
yes and people run dreamstate?
so can ids/misery bot
yes because you can only get 2/3 misery
you can get 5/5 shadow weaving no problem
but only 2 points in misery
or was it 4
i dont remember
3/5
tbh running shadow weaver is possibility in next phase
it tracks how many shadow bolts benefitted from isb
@jpaint pretty sure it works in other way too
so you can just assume it happens evenly
isb drops/comes up when bolt is flying
shadow is equal personal and way better raid dps
t6 bis
not really
we dont lose crit
we dont lose anything at all tbh
on average fire is 0 dps higher
if ur using consumables (dark rune)
what disinformation?
all based on sim
what?
you can sim it yourself
shadow sim setup
fire sim setup
i might have missed some debuffs / items but i dont think so
oh yeah i was missing weapon enchants
now that i added them shadow is ahead 10 dps
bro
sim it yourself
updated fire setup
updated shadow setup
3010 vs 2999
so did anyone double check my sim setups
dont think i missed anything
@jpaint you were calling me a troll
did you check my setups
:peepohigh: you had raid weapon
i was pumping with stormcaller
https://i.nuuls.com/O3SCZ.png
cant beat my stormcaller fire VR
:peepohigh:
3 months ago
wdym resto shamans beat?
they bring totems and lust
they automatically beat priests
bro if they dont buff t6
people 2 heal it eventually probably
yea idk 2 heal might be rough without swp gear
on everyone
4 will be done for sure
speedrunners might try 3
flk and seeding
it is until first mob dies
you seed off pet
its literally 0 wasted dps if seeding off pet
succubus eats isb unless you manually cast lash
just use imp?
ask for buffs and shield
its not
ZD is better
ZD wins even on 30-44s sim
on 15-30s bowiz+chronicle wins
why would your chances of getting ZD be slim to none?
7 targets
7 is cap i think
with t6 gear
toc isnt bad its just better for mages
:pepebrain:
its not tho
ZD always bis for locks
for mages it depends on many factors
you can go check mage discords sims sheet
eles take dagger+shield
spriests mace+ something
mage toc+chronicle
moonkin crit dagger + something
ofc some guilds will give glaives to rogue
love it when they put skull on their sheet
yeah
ZD is like 5 dps upgrade for spriests
over mindblade
massive
its very small compared to warlocks up from p2 bis
is spriest sim easy to use
time to redpill them
because warlock benefits from it most?
your average guild should think about swp
wrong
early in swp ur using bt/hyjal t6 pieces which have hit
and in bis bis weapon/oh has 0 hit
what do you mean jpaint
when ZD isnt even mage bis?
especially p4
dildo is spriest prio
2nd goes to pala
@jpaint i was talking about t6 bis dude
not current phase
obviously fire is better atm
top logs are parse guilds
in parse runs you go arc/frost mages
and pray you highroll on shadow lock
@CommunismForDummies ??
mindblade is literally same as magusblade
and most guilds priod mindblade for non sword users
and it can go different way
i played with stormcaller until 3rd fang dropped
because almost no one had magusblade OR mindblade
najentus dagger is ele prio
after few first hyjals people will start looking at locks/mages differently
and their aoe dps
difference is vashj chest & wand really were only good for locks
not really
spriest is there mainly for misery and shadow weaving
and what class NEEDS that extra mana?
only arcane mage
we get pantaloons
insane haste legs if no haste gem in
but the thing is
giving spriest ZD & haste rings wont change anything
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=33584/pantaloons-of-arcane-annihilation
:peepohigh:
its omega bis for seed if no haste gems
havent seen vestments after 1st week
🙂
did anyone kill any bosses on ptr
did they boost t5 loot
3x loots from solarian etc
runes are too expensive
:peepohigh:
just do dailies and you get infinite gold
have one xmute alt
why arent you male bunny @GAMING WARLORD
going to be 1½h ssc+tk
time to do naxx
skull + zd vs toc+double pipe is 23 dps difference?
whats wrong with that class
why do they say skull is op foe aoe
for aoe
when they have 145 permanent haste trinket+tlc
whats wrong with those guys
first decent lock class trinket in whole game
nice one blizzard
yes fellow warlock players :Pepeclown:
bis for vael
every caster will be on skull if you allow them to sr it
:peepohigh:
sr is just horrible
we used it on our alt raids, i won first 2 rolls and now im full bis on mage
other mages have like few pieces of t5
no its not
crit cloak is better for mages
fire isnt viable
and even for them
fire mages rly want crit
some mechanics nerfs probably
hits less etc
will be fun to do kara tier t5
nothing does anything
just do dailies
EZ 30k honor before s3
im going for neck+ring
assuming ring is in
will be bis for aoe until 2nd trash ring
should be?
its s3 item
i didnt check if rings were in on ptr
but its s3 item so should be
pretty sure trinket wont be in
alliance has slut goats tho
belf racial is bis
:peepohigh:
its passive
no extra button to press
tailoring shoulders are only good if no haste gems
NO WINGS = NO WEAR
oblivion shoulders with 2x haste gems should be better
NO WINGS = NO WEAR
2
but dont know if its 6/6 or 7/5 tables
we better pray its 6/6
or skull is NEVER dropping
no
glaives is bonus
wait skull shares weapon table?
:peepohigh:
well ZD and skull could be in different 6/6 tables
thats the best case scenario
?
it could be same as vashj
KT
vashj doesnt always drop weapon
bro
illidan bow is bis tho
mana is good for hunters
if they care about total dps
yeah hunters are known for not having mana problems
especially on trash
gl with that jow uptime on trash
you should write thesis on how poorly blizz manages everything
like fucking tbc timeline
and now they have massive issues with difficulty of bt
because everyone is full t5 bis
their dogshit decisions just keep snowballing
weapons nerfed too probably
KT going to be 5 min fight with 2 mins of afk
you prio SR set to warlock tanks tho
if hes tanking illidan he gets as many pieces as he wants
mount hyjal should be 12 waves and no heart drops
:Pepeclown:
hopefully we get that version
honored should be doable
first week
trash mobs should give rep to that point atleast
but current t6 is too easy
too easy is a problem too
nerfing is very bad for speedrunning tho
t5 splits is so stupid
splits are only useful in next phase
why
locks get like 50 dps from p2 bis
compared to p1 bis
they pretty much do if you run optimal comp
mages get their bis in 4 weeks
just add different difficulties
:peepohigh:
heroic BT
heroic hyjal
add 1 extra loot to heroic
shared lockout ofc
:peepohigh:
ofc they would
no one wants to run LFR t6
spriests take the dildo
and they will be happy
make holy priest shadow / misery weaver
people run dreamstate so its okay
you just cut mages
replace with locks
shadow+misery weaver holy
no spriests eat isb
we need shadow weaver holy
yeah trash on lock was so imporant
:Pepeclown:
pressing cor and praying ur sb has time to land
did they fix seed bug
:Pepeclown:
they wont nerf it before reset
oh yeah na has reset earlier
did they actually push the nerfs out
nah you do KT+solarian
and in ssc depends what people need
its like 15 min raid anyway
alar drops dogshit
who ever made that game should add spell queue
:peepohigh:
are nerfs out on NA?
guys i think if haste gems are in we go for orange haste gems instead of yellows
sims way better on ST
its realistic bis list too tbh
give crit cloak to meme classes
pass on it and take healer cloak
well thats a bait
and mages arent top 3 dps in swp
t6 helm has wings tho
great meme value
you either use t6 helm or shoulders
in swp bis
i would go for t6 helm personally if i didnt have sapph enchant rdy for t6 shoulders
swp goggles are dog
if you have sapph enchant on t6 shoulders use them, if not use t6 helm for wings
@Foolipe yes so will lock
whats this argument?
bro im not the one shilling mages aoe
@jpaint tLC is actually insane for mages
it is tho
tlc is just insane
and you have to remember haste = more mana spent
tlc is basically "free" dmg for mages
haste is more mana spent
they do tho
but if t6 stays easy as it is
doesnt matter rly
whens the patch out
:peepohigh:
we need to find out if they fixed seed bug
🤡
it might not even be bis for seeding
if we get haste gems
this phase parses are full meme
you cant get 99 on moro/kt/vashj if ur in decent guild
not false
too much downtime
too much aoe / too few murlocs on morogrim
this is lock discord
or simply stop caring about parses
no?
just fights that dont punish high raid dps
like vashj/moro/kt
just like vashj p2 & kt p23 shouldnt count
if people stop aoe then wipe it
who cares
is the patch out?
nerfs are out?
is seed fixed??
someone test seed
:peepohigh:
is seed still bugged on NA
:peepohigh:
blizz hates locks
is seed bug still in
?
on NA
only need to delay CDs perfectly for 2 minutes
🤡
nice one blizzard
:peepohigh:
LFR t5
no?
prenerf was how it was
actually
real t5 was even harder
45 min trash respawn time
so hydross one phaseable now
:peepohigh:
im glad they finally nerfed hydross
didnt KT lose like 2m hp
why would you kill phoenixes
you already ignore them
illidan didnt seem melee friendly at all
melees basically have to afk in glaive phase
if t6 stays same as on ptr
melee stack will be meta probably
mobs had so low hp
but whatever
you run 4 locks anyway
seed is still bugged
:peepohigh:
what the fuck blizzard
no?
hunter pets dont scale from arp
idk if they scale from haste either
i literally read few wowhead comments and they confirmed its not ICD
whats wrong with physical dps theorycrafters
didnt need to be tested
wowhead comments confirmed it has no ICD
stacking doesnt have diminished benefits
more locks / mages you have more evenly shit dies
top 1 run had optimal comp tho
and sure you can take balanced comp but people actually need to play well
split dmg and not just nuke skull/cross
gearing 8 locks and 3 mages inst hard at all
in classic?
probably 5 heal first week
depends if we get prenerf or not
if its prenerf
going to be very hard boss
well if its prenerf you cant go in with greens
if its postnerf u dont need sr
mages are like worst class on prenerf mother
u only need 2
locks are very good tho
nether protection ?
rocket boots?
was?
t6 trash just has too low hp
to stack locks
balanced comp might be the play
4 locks / 1 mage
rest furies/hunters
give healers spriest
cut healers
crixx said on reddit bt will be buffed
and said he has inside knowledge
feels like trash was postnerf too
if its prenerf mother you either need epic SR or super heavy lock stack with nether protection
why would you ever use s2 weao
weapon
imagine using 0 stam gear
s2 weapon is dog
just use fang
and ele isnt a melee
big bonus
why would you run arcanes next phase
ele should be in destro grp
yeah notas 2 lock comp worked really well
🤡
before a wipe?
if you wipe you wipe
only successful runs count
illidan flame phase seems pretty monka with melees
🤡
whats the point of that comp
is that 6 healers?
you dont go fire in any case next phase
shadow is better
you are forced to bring one mage for council tho
unless people find a way to cheese it
no?
this phase fire locks were better
and next phase shadow is better
you always need misery
or instead of running dogshit healer
run spriest and give it to healers
allowing you to cut more healers
yea you go catabolt
catabolt + nether protection if not tanking illidan
(assuming mother is post nerf)
if its prenerf you want to get incinerate talent
immolate spec is better rn
but you only cast it on 2nd global
and fights like leo with threat reset
!skull
nah taking toc is grief
give it to mages & palas
yep
only contested item is noose which we should pass anyway
take haste belt
!skull
cast it if you have threat problems
otherwise just spam shadow bolt
unless you have imp scorch ofc
https://i.nuuls.com/7WVJT.png
mage prio obviously
🤡
@Skycrab imagine having vestments
:peepohigh:
@Madarb 10 crit+6sp/5crit + 6sp/6stam
:pepebrain:
maybe today vestments drop
no vestments
and whats up my with my name
:peepohigh:
you just go normal shadow weaver
dont even need ids
did anyone test the magtheridons bag on ptr
do old ones give epic gems
griefing raid dps
:peepohigh:
they would tho
fire lock is especially big for curse locks
next phase shadow is just better
its not tho
shadow is same dps
and more raid dps
catabolt actually sims better than fire personal dps
with 85% isb
you dont lose like any crit at all next phase
and get haste
maybe seed bug is finally fixed
:copium:
!seedbug
prot shouldnt get first set
unless they make t6 harder
prot can tank hyjal in t5 no problem
and prot will mt everything but mother
no? 4pc is biggest upgrade in whole game
so does zd and skull
taking toc is grief
pass on it and take ZD
its way better for mages
toc is better for mages
than for locks
its pretty simple
isb
it benefits raid dps tho
even with 3 locks
i think prot warrior is very good in lock stack
gives demo/thunder clap / sunders for free
you dont need 2 prot pallys in a lock stack
all my takes were based
if anyone thought hunters would be even decent
they were retarded
problem with furies is why would you take them
when locks are better
sims same as kt neck
omega good for seeding tho
furys dont know glaive is kebab prio?
slam is dogshit to play
got my first 100 bros
p2.5 moroes
:pepebrain:
ok thats not based bro
you can always fix it
post your setup and ill fix it
fastest kara speedrun too
p2.5
its bis basically
quags catches up in full bis
no
in sim quags=motc in full bis
even in full bis you want to use motc
its just that its not a big deal if u dont have it
@Ghingis wait ur using pvp  weapon on ally?
this is unfixable
switch cloak to badge one
gem hit
hit / shadow dmg cloak
but allies really dont want that
illi cloak does literally nothing for healers unless it allows you to take less healers
@jpaint no more dps means shit dies faster
which means you get out of the raid faster
looks like you didnt
you said more dps doesnt do anything
warlocks just get everything other classes dont even want
t6,zd,skull,haste cloak
we are actually passing on the only contested item
noose
because haste belt is better
how is it a bait
mages want toc
spriest/moonkin/ele dagger/dildo
yeah i wasnt totally right about everything
🤡
arc/fire + fire locks?
stack them all together and cleave/seed it
:pepebrain:
you can just soak the first conflag
and nuke her down after it i think
dies in 10s
so even shamans agree?
cloak lock prio
everything isnt lock prio bro
we should be passing on noose
wdym
everyone gets loot
how do they even lose to holy priests
they have lust
and totems
yeah dont take haste cloak and compete on crit cloak with literally every other caster
🤡
so int has value
but haste is super good?
blizz is on a massive clock now
people cba to raid this nerfed t5 very long
@KilLogic too bad ptr isnt even up
:Pepeclown:
its basically a race to get seeds off
especially on solarian trash
downrank?
do dps classes really downrank
AND THEY WANT HASTE?
well seen soon probably
if haste gems are in on 2nd ptr
they will stay in
@Jujutsu no we take ZD
ur using 0 hit gems anyway next phase
mages take toc+chronicle
dont complain its better
if you think mages are perfectly doing CDs with haste
ur actually insane
ZD is lock prio
or you just take 0 haste gear and pump normally
idk whats so hard
just gem it bro
why do you even want zergling staff
go toc+chronicle
nah
it would be instant death if it did fall dmg
OH glaive isnt even fury bis bros...
its not looking good fellow fury warriors
because pvp oh is better?
someone said here OH wasnt bis without mh
so its basically wasted until both drop
isnt KT dagger literally better than glaive OH
legendary KT dagger
doesnt matter
even if they fully tryhard cant see them on meters
warlocks scale the best with haste
just like they scale the best from any stat
idk how fury copers will survive
looks like locks will be kings in wotlk too
14 kills
seen one vestments
:peepohigh:
i think well be seeing 11k crits next phase
idk if sim shows the max hits
11k isnt possible rn tbh
even 10k is pretty hard
10k incinerate has flame caps etc
show me a single 11k sb no extra dmg buffs
like KT / mag
@Ryusei you basically need flame cap + trinket + blood fury + t4 proc + destro pot at same time
well 100sp is a lot
@Michael thats not 11k
:peepohigh:
badge oh is good
fathom is barely better for st
fathom omega bis for seeding tho
oh yeah 11k might be doable if you run affli
thats on average
if you go for high roll sp is king
@jpaint is that with affli
most people dont run affli
use both
sp is king
sextant is better than icon
quags is just best
double active is just horrible to use
more gaps
even if you use /cqs
ur going to get gaps
using mana pots / trinkets
quags is just better
/cqs disable spell queueing
ur always going to get a gap
gap between casts
you want to avoid them at any costs
even if you spam the button
ur going to get a gap
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/9hxYRmMvcr32VGNw#fight=14&source=28&type=casts&view=timeline
used /qcs
and you can see the gap
sr is worst possible loot system
if you run with same people
even /roll is better
no mages never haste cap
they stagger CDs perfectly for 2 mins
no no mages dont want ashtongue, they want skull+ZD tho ofc
:Pepeclown:
they just stagger CDs dont worry
yep mages are just going to stagger CDs for 2 mins
instead of not gearing haste and pumping normally
thats the play
fellow mage players why would we use skull instead of MQG
isnt mqg just better?
locks oom on every seed pack tho
tell your source to fix seed bug
:peepohigh:
bros
are haste gems in
is 10 haste one in too
@a smart alex orange haste / sp gems
full haste on oblivion set
seed bug still in
remember to report it
seed bug is backend
:peepohigh:
report it
no we take zergling staff and gem haste
you replace mages way before eles tho
🤡
people still dont understand how haste works
tried to explain it back in fight club
but people just dont understand it
just gem oranges on st gear
yellow haste on oblivion
fire isnt viable next phase
who cares
well unless they changed mother
did they make her prenerf
its not even technically
shadow sims at worst 10 dps worse
i think i got it to sim better
its not more than that
shadow sims literally better
@jpaint and i linked my configs you didnt want to open :peepohigh:
fire
shadow
oh so ur not going to take isb at all?
🤡
did mages test supremus fire res
what about illidan flames
@jpaint only the neck is different bro
cba to gear again
and what i simmed spellthread was better anyway
ok give me "bis fire" export
which sims higher
(fire isnt viable next phase)
this phase fire is 100-150 dps up
next phase its dps loss
@jpaint ok so why did fire sim worse in my setups?
did i miss some debuff or what?
no i didnt
i went oranges
which sims best btw
haste belt sims best too
haste rings sim best
bro ur using malediction 3 and IDS
OH NO NO NO  NO NO NO
ur doing maledictions sims
ur using green jc neck
which people wont be using realistically
ok i did same buffs as you
now my setup sims 30 dps better
"fixed" sim
ur doing shorter fight too btw
so you have higher lust uptime
no you gear wrong
im getting 3183 with same fight duration and buffs
?
why
im simming shadow mainly
because its the best
3183 shadow
your fire setup doesnt even come close
while shadow brings higher raid dps AND personal dps
its better anyway probably
because of socket bonuses
idk if its
havent simmed
and hard to sim isb uptime
going red gems is actual grief
you need hit from leg/gloves setbonus
vashj socket bonus is good
helm socket is good
boots is another good orange/blue item
just go crit/sp
well shoulders only
i would only go 2x red on shoulders
you need 2x blues tho
vashj chest is +5 socket bonus
no way eles gain 400 dps
no way
orange haste gems are bis tho
idk how its a meme
and full haste sims 10 dps worse
ur looking at massive dps loss if you need to cast any shadow bolts in oblivion gear
have to see how packs die if its worth it
idk bro
t6 is pretty good
pretty sure mages want sp
they have infinite mana anyway
mages gem int atm
because its 8 vs 9
next phase its 10 int vs 12 sp
lock prio
unlucky
@AlexTheSeal yell for innervate ofc
:peepohigh:
they have infinite mana
dont people understand only reason locks want haste is because of seed being dogshit ability
with 0 scaling from anything expect haste
:peepohigh:
giving healers gear means you cut healers tho
are they sure they want that
:peepohigh:
well its simple
do you lust healers? no? why would you give them dps cloak
shamans could use t2.5
but apparently its not good
they dont want haste
do you know how much haste -0.4s from chain heal is?
yeah bro give bis dps cloak to healers
so literally every caster can compete on 2nd best cloak
actually its 1. bis for locks
no?
you want haste cloak
@Xelrog its literally not
its not bro
yeah even with haste gems
no
its 2 dps behind

its bis
it helps loot distribution
so everyone doesnt want literally the same cloak
you think other casters will be happy waiting for 10th crit cloak to drop
ZA haste cloak is worse
why does healer get prio on bis lock cloak until swp
it is bis?
if you pass on healer cloak
ur competing with 10 other people on crit cloak
trash drops seem omega rare
gl farming hit cloaks
slippers are the one item that doesnt matter
only locks/mages want it anyway
not really
skull > ZD > t6
we are passing on the only contested item (noose) other classes should be just happy
haste boots?
those arent good really imo
sims 10 dps worse
other classes dont even want ros neck
why wouldnt lock take it
reds sim worse tho
@Xelrog that doesnt make sense
so they are pushing out post nerf content
nice one blizzard
now fix the fucking seed bug
:peepohigh:
WHAT THE FUCK
FIX IT
go report seed bug right now
:peepohigh:
no wings
best thing is its realistic bis
compared to mage one
tbh prenerf mother would have been too hard
for most people
they nerf swp 1 month after release
because people cant kill bosses
blizz shutting down ptr again
locks can easily run 0 sr
with nether protection
you have to be very unlucky to die
and always can hs
if blizz actually cares maybe they should fix seed bug
:peepohigh:
zoomer is a mage right
in this setup haste cloak sims better
and if you arent dooming haste cloak gains value
comes from hyjal vendor too
@Mayhem wrong
its bis even with ZD
and omega bis on aoe
well on my sim it is
1
but idk if you should assume you will have 2x lust in every fight
including trash
and just for loot distribution you should give crit cloak to other casters
its 100 more dps on sim
@AlexTheSeal what do you mean catch up with locks?
warriors actually got upgrades this phase and locks got nothing
wdym
fire is bis this phase
shadow
@Lazerz im basically only casting it 2nd global and then spam shadow bolt
and thats with normal spec
in vanilla if you died you died in 0.1s
no time to heal anyway
how many non tier pieces do swp bosses drop
those bosses have like 30 items each
can you turn in slivers?
how
no way this is blizzlike
no way this is blizzlike
and all those loots dropped?
:peepohigh:
i know i wont see all of them even drop
wdym
palas will be rolling around with toc
its palas after mages and you run 1-2 mages next phase
they were on first ptr
@Michael
:peepohigh:
saw my only vestments week 1
like 20 kills now
moro is hardest for sure
just do the healer cheese
cant wipe
killing the healer is hardest part usually
mages get more out of hit actually
they are never capped on their filler
@Mayhem its 3 dps worse with living ruby
than sunking
yeah p2 gear
ofc you get it for seeding
put a 10 haste gem on it and its bis for seeding long time
🤡
yeah castin stuff faster means you dont get extra casts unless fight lasts 10 min
🤡
china ran 2x arc/fire with 4 locks
if you are running affli ur actually griefing
yeah bro going toc so you get sunflare prio is real smart
you better pray it drops
meanwhile ur griefing the raid
giving mages ZD
sure you can
how are you dropping hit in early swp
new t6 pieces give hit iirc
well in the beginning you are only getting tier
swp loot tables are massive
because loot tables are too big
gl getting lock loot to drop
not all locks have fathomstone either
and so what if they had
its 6 dps better than badge oh
https://i.nuuls.com/kYIWU.png
yeah its more than that bro
crit isnt undervalued tbh
they run tlc+rep trinket
always on aoe
you dont have any hit issues in swp bis
assuming you have ele
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/iGtmazgK5RUa9dLvC4JZVg
you are actually overcap but who cares
actually cant drop it anywhere
dont want to get 2nd naxx enchant
hes using pvp weapon i think
:peepohigh:
ABC - Always Be Casting
:peepohigh:
do priests actually have fbfriday
1.2s bolts
:peepohigh:
in swp
hes ready to raid t6
haste was bis
:peepohigh:
no but what if you have to move then haste does nothing
🤡
(you can never get extra hits because of haste)
🤡
if you crit crit was useless stat, if you dont crit crit was useless stat
stack sp&haste kids
:peepohigh:
what breakpoints
wear good items
use good gems
dont need to think about breakpoints
could be
orc racial too ofc
yeah it wasnt crit rng
or gear
🤡
or the fact that raids had 2-3 locks
they didnt abc
didnt use pots / runes
🤡
its simple for locks
haste is same as do more dmg %
im going for full haste
fbfriday drama?
:peepohigh:
can jannies give my old name back
@Occupied 🤡
what if they fixed seed
after 1000 bug reports
sure bro
chicken will be up on every boss
who cares about parses
probably stayed logged out during trash
bowiz smuggling is a meme
use it for whole pull or not at all
so dont do it
my guild has never done chicken exploiting
how does MT preserve buffs
wcl discord has a lot of cat girls
what
why would you ban it
just dont be parse brain
easy fix
then do 6h raids
i dont care
not my problem
sac too
its just fair locks would be too op otherwise
oh no prot pala taking toc?
🤡
thats horrible
@GAMING WARLORD haste cloak is bis
who ever is saying haste cloak isnt bis is wrong
haste oranges aer omega bis
full haste is only 10 dps worse than oranges
https://i.nuuls.com/jbBob.png
its bis
@gremmer🐢
its called "bowiz smuggling" not boweawing btw
:peepohigh:
same buffs ofc?
🤡
would want to see malediction and PI in there
or IDS
export it my dude
or are you doing noose with 2x epic gems?
that might be small upgrade
@gremmer🐢 post the export my dude
:peepohigh:
i wanna see how you cheesed it
@gremmer🐢 you called my absolute p3 bis setup shit, now post yours
:peepohigh:
noose is like 5 dps better
and requires 2 epic gems
just go for haste belt
just give it to mages
they are getting like 0 loot
jannies trolling
@gremmer🐢 ur setup is worse tho
with correct settings
im doing realistic bis list
and haste cloak is bis
noose isnt
haste cloak is bis tho
https://i.nuuls.com/FIoEL.png
🤡
yeah simming 150s - 210s sucks
instead of 120-121
🤡
no malediction
most people wont be running affli next phase
like they arent running affli now
biggest thing was probably 120-121s fight duration
specific breakpoint making haste cloak worse
just do 150-210s
its the best
no
vestment is good place to get set bonus
because its +5 sp
and you need 2 blues
if haste gems are in you go 2x yellow+1blue in vestments always
if not then probably go 3x reds
🤡
only sims the best bros
no im shilling gem with yellow tag
aka oranges or yellows
and yeah its not a big problem to go full haste gems
?? full haste gems is literally 10 dps worse
u guys are actually trolling
if you cast a single seed with ur st set equipped
yellows will be better
thats exactly how haste works
every single fight is going to be 10s where you start casting exactly at 0.00001s ?
10 haste is better than 12sp if you include set bonuses
he asked if 10 haste is better than 12sp
it is
it is tho
show me a better setup with red gems
there wont be an one
because yellows are better because of set bonuses
no shadow should be gemming oranges if parse brain
yellows if playing for total raid dps
its the realistic bis bro
why 75?
75 is omega low
its not tho
especially next phase
show me a log of consistent 75%
https://maarslet.github.io/DebuffCheck/
use this for isb uptime btw
its not
@gremmer🐢 ur using yellows for set bonuses in this setup tho
because they are bis
and my setup is 5 dps worse while not taking highly contested red gems OR noose
you guys just underestimate how going heavy on haste impacts isb uptime
:peepohigh:
its a feelcraft thing
your bolts will hit more often
while critting just as much
isb falls of due to spriest eating all the stacks
alliance has slut goats
:peepohigh:
its not fair
do dailies
surely vestments drop this reset right
so you take legs
not a big deal
but its retarded to not do vashj
takes like 10 min
drops phys and lock bis
ok lurker is 4 mins
hydross 2 mins
now ur looking at 20 min raid
maybe they dont have time because they wont do 10 min raid to get bis gear
solarian drops bis wand
hydross drops nothing
yeah bis wand is irrelevant
guarenteed insane neck is irrelevant
KT neck is bis for a lot of classes
pretty much every non lock
@Xenthis nah you run prot pala+holy pala+disc priest+22 warlocks
shadow blast is only 8.7k ?
dont even need sr
maybe do neck if you want to play it safe
spells cant crit bro
hydross autoattacks are melee hits which deal nature/frost dmg
not spells
shadow catches up in full p3 bis
i think priest buff+flask switch is enough
if max hit is 8750
well its doable
if max hit is 11k
use hildi sim
:peepohigh:
@Mayhem its called "bowiz smuggling"
:peepohigh:
no its bowiz smuggling
:peepohigh:
it was always called bowiz smuggling
:peepohigh:
if you have the immolate spec
cast it on 2nd global and after that just spam shadow bolt
if you are catabolt only cast shadow bolt
its bowiz smuggling
@Blow did someone say mages actually scale tho
only warlocks scale
channeled elements arent highly contested
@Mayhem ur trolling right
theres no way people still dont understand how haste works
its always 100% gain
YOU ALWAYS CAST FASTER WITH HASTE
how dont people understand this
haste works always
your tap is faster
means you can cast faster after movement
its always a gain
haste always makes you cast more spells
because you cast faster
HASTE IS ALWAYS A GAIN
just like crit & hit is always a gain
@jpaint thats how it works literally
if you have 5% haste
in long run you get 5% more casts
raid consists of many many many fights
in that raid if you have 5% haste, you get 5% more casts
people still dont understand how haste works
actually insane
exact same problem as in fight club 4 years ago
AND PEOPLE STILL DONT UNDERSTAND IT
https://i.nuuls.com/wPE6E.png
this explains haste
doesnt matter how long fight is
thats right
ZD is better
expect if fight is literal sub 10-20s
zd makes you cast curses faster
its just better
they are literally the only parse guild in whole game
who cares
hit and crit are shit stats too
because you dont get benefit from them all the time
sp too
sp isnt beneficial if you miss
you cant say sp is always beneficial
and then say haste isnt always beneficial
im saying both of them are always beneficial
ur saying one of them isnt and other is
sp could be better than haste if we didnt have seed
but we do
and if you cast any seeds with ur sp set
you already lost
@Skycrab no i said it ironically
because someone just here said haste doesnt always work
if u guys think haste is bad stat
whats ur opinion on bloodlust
because nota ran meme comp?
and bloodfury does nothing on seed
which is most of the raid
as much as you can without losing too much other stats
3100 is with malediction
3000 is normal without any cheat debuffs
and its realistic numbers compared to mage clown sims
so does bloodlust mean anything on 30s fight
or 45s?
probably not right?
sp is 0 dps in that case too
https://i.nuuls.com/S2NCD.png
finally finished my seet sed
@Lundbeck t5
i have fetish never use it tho
prism is better
trust hildi sim
:peepohigh:
we already seized the means of loot distribution
its called bowiz smuggling
:peepohigh:
they have apustajas
helpers
https://i.nuuls.com/-KseC.png
mages overdosing
fetish is very hard to use
because of 30s cd
thats why you want to use threat trinket
so you can seed first global
@Shaggydaggy if playing optimally every time its aoe pull and no CD
thats every dps class
longer fights everyone does less dps
warlock probably loses the least if fight goes long
??
are u trolling
not having spell queue is actual grief
whats the difference between 1% haste and 30% haste?
@jacob none at all? both make you cast more stuff
if you think bloodlust is good
you cant say 1% haste is useless
oh so now bloodlust is useless in short fight?
🤡
shadowburn is dps loss tho
better to life tap
which means you can start casting soon after life tap
or just dont buy spellblade
gruul / kara weapon is good enough
its 20sp
yeah bros casting shadowbolts with bowiz is so good
🤡
but haste is a bad stat btw
never use bowiz on single target
simple as that
you might not even get an extra cast
meaning all that haste was wasted
:Pepeclown:
dont bowiz smuggle
equip it out of combat for seed packs
if you have ZD dont switch
its only worth it if you dont have ZD
its simple
i just told you when its worth it and when its not
@Aloysius even on 15-32s fight ZD beats bowiz
and thats when fight is always aoe capped
if we go below aoe cap wont be even close
yes i know
on 8 targets ZD wins
on 6 targets ZD wins by 70 dps
no?
🤡
ZD is better
even when aoe capped
no you dont understand it
ZD is better for seeding even with low duration fights
this guy is passing on ZD and coping probably
i have been absolutely right about everything tho
engi is dead prof in swp unless ur a  speedrunner and need rocket boots
yes you can and do less dps than wearing free good items
if hes asking is engi worth it will he be throwing nades every tap?
bro 12 spellcloths & 12 shadowcloths
are you saying 12 spellcloths & 12 shadowcloths arent free
for OMEGA bis chest
yes you need loot to drop
it drops from trash so its farmable
right @Mayhem
right @Mayhem
only palas can bowiz smuggle
yeah remember when everyone quit farming naxx
because tbc was coming out
naxx gear lasted literally until lvl 70
and most people raid because its fun
naxx gear lasted literally until lvl 70
and most people raid because its fun
yes its omega bis
@Ryusei some items just are omega bis
like haste cloak, zd and skull
you will be using ZD until you happen to get sunfire
you will be using ZD until you get KJ dagger
thats very long time
what about female trolls?
shadow vulve isnt up instantly, you want to cast immolate as 2nd global in this phase
make the chicken tank
locks dont want scorch tho
shadow is better
until next phase
isnt it cheap now
they used in tbc i think
didnt in vanilla
:peepohigh:
why is t*rande banned word
shes my waifu
petersonian statement
im going for haste belt
doesnt matter really
less 2 epic gems you need
@Xelrog doubt that
sounds very scuffed
@Xelrog its 10 dps
if they think haste belt is bis for them
let them have it lmao
well they arent taking noose if they take haste belt
nah
we should other classes take the contested items
like belt
and maybe boots
but thats a big maybe
every caster doent want them
boomkins eles have other boots
spriests should use FSW
its only mages & locks
give it to mages first imo
why are you simming demo bro
what do you mean
i always said we should pass on contested items
skull is warlock only item
ZD is lock prio
if haste is so good for spriests
why do they gem reds
this doesnt make sense
lmao
no way
2x haste rings is uncontested btw
🤡
the class is
:Pepeclown:
sim assumes meta gem works always
its open source
fix it if you care
brutallus in swp ofc
:pepebrain:
there wont be
blizz hates warlocks
and if they happen to be enslaveable wont show up as warlock dps
because kihra hates warlocks
we need to sim optimal range for best rISB uptime
:peepohigh:
based on my feelscraft melee range might be best
but its hard to get in there
and also threat problems
@Paraconsistent yes thats why im thinking melee is best
:peepohigh:
thats same as having more threat
thats why you have problems on VR
it is tho
120 sp is massive loss
for 5 casters
imagine rolling alliance for every female for herself
yeah bros gehennas will die for sure
not a single horde guild will leave because allies are quitting
wdym
most people dont want to be on losing side
only servers like gehennas had real pvp
🤡
just like crit and hit works if you get full numbers ofc
looks like haste actually sims lower than sp on hildi sim
atleast on seed
which doesnt make sense at all
not when its aoe capped
im looking into it but could be very hard to find
now im simming full haste gems vs full sp gems, full haste seems to be way better
now the sim seems to be working correctly again :peepohigh:
i think i made it guys :peepohigh:
THE omega bis list
https://i.nuuls.com/3Id08.png
it works very well with channeled elements
only way to fix the hit
its the omega real dps bis
mark is way better bro
especially with full haste setups
now i just gotta sim this vs oblivion seed :peepohigh:
@gremmer🐢 its bis REAL total dps
i still need to test is vs oblivion
but oblivion loses a lot of dps if you have to cast shadow bolts with it
and hard to get epic gems for oblivion
lulek is probably a millionaire
from wow gold
maria fucked up petri pull?
spriests get good OH in ZA
they like haste right
but not enough to gem it ofc
ay govnah
im too busy making channeled elements omega bis setup
:peepohigh:
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/823471727081422849/924046797989625886/Untitled.png
we need this emote
:peepohigh:
idk if people will be selling mounts
its 10 man + 3 days reset
guarenteed drop
dont take reds if haste is in
go full haste like a chad
@Ghingis gems were in on both ptr
belf is 2nd best warlock race
:peepohigh:
nothing wrong with them
arguably best if you cant press blood fury
belfs get free +10 sp
and insane t6 slutmog
male belf isnt based
:peepohigh:
thats gay
you reroll tailoring craft shoulders and then go back to engi
:peepohigh:
imagine using tabard on a caster
@Mayhem you were right, nethervoid cloak is infact omega bis
https://i.nuuls.com/_JSD_.png
this is the p3 omega real total dps bis
ofc
well they seem to be in right now
blizz could change it sure
306
19.4%
but you still kinda want healer cloak for seeding
you use the hit from skull
you NEED the hit from skull
no you need it
@AlexTheSeal lock until ICC if i play
and might just play lock in ICC too to dab on fury copers
@Mayhem sim is opensource, just code it
i will never see skull drop :peepohigh:
@AlexTheSeal yeah bro fury will maybe pump in ICC
pumper lock will pump harder probably
nothing wrong with gehennas tho
allies just dodging pvp
who cares if theres no allies
yeah because theres no pvp to dodge
most people want to play on pvp servers but not pvp
thats basically every server expect gehennas
@Occupied yeah dodging pvp
alliance died the second maitoz/apes quit
no thats just cope
gehennas wont die
its the horde server
t*annymaw is the ally server
som tbc will be popping off
nah
aslong they do correct release timeline
and actually make the game hard
it will pop off
buff t4
buff t5
buff t6
release t4+t5+hyjal day 1
you can actually make 25 man content hard
but you cant make 40 man content hard
@Nono bro you always take the threat talent
even if ur tanking illidan
so
you still take it for the range
and this spec is dogshit
go normal destro without nether protection
hf griefing the raid
you lose like 50% of ur dps
it does?
criminals use illegal weapons
not legal weapons
wonder why
p4 will have good seed gear
but youll get badges from ZA & kara i think
so wont be a problem
brutallus is the first "real" dps check
10.5m hp and 6 min timer
did they nerf hydross adds btw
because mage sucked?
mage is only good because of 2.4.3 changes
we got bugged seed in classic
:peepohigh:
in real tbc it worked correctly tho
thats different bug bro
@Foolipe hes right tho
its literal 0 dps difference
go shadow
at 85% isb uptime shadow is better
which is realistic
main tank? :Pepeclown:
hes rerolling pala for next phase?
lmao
thats just wrong
mage is 100x easier
it is tho
if you think lock is the most braindead shit ever
you havent played mage
you havent tho
literally anyone can play mage and pump
on lock its very hard
literally dont stand in whirlwinds
and you cant die
whats so hard
its not riskier tho
you dont have 7k hp?
you have 9.5k
and iceblock
you just said mages have 7k hp
ur the one trolling
literally dont stand in whirlwind
and you cant die on mage
its my alch alt / alt
and why would i want to play mage
when they peaked this phase
yes they will be 2nd most likely
if you run mage(s)
looks like you are forced to run one mage t6
but dont think theres anything in swp
you will never die with nether protection
just keep HS ready
theres no way NP doesnt remove FA dmg
:Pepeclown:
not even blizzard could do that
seed is still bugged btw :peepohigh:
https://tbc.wowhead.com/blue-tracker/topic/eu/clockwork-rocket-bot-winter-veil-gift-333037
but atleast they fixed this
:peepohigh:
im suspecting they just dont have any programmers working on classic
so no one actually can fix the bug
it works
he got FA at ~1.07
and NP procs
0 dmg taken after that
well looks like he got it from sinister beam
but doesnt take FA dmg
surely it can proc from FA too
https://i.nuuls.com/ow053.png
https://i.nuuls.com/VtBlK.png
he got NP from sinister beam
np removed FA dmg
or just lucky coincide
i wonder if its a bug
:peepohigh:
blizz really hates us
whats the point of making nether protection
but then making it useless
https://i.nuuls.com/SlYW_.png
its not looking good
:peepohigh:
because of blizzards dogshit code
seed is still bugged
STILL BUGGEd
wasnt in original tbc
it wasnt
EJ doesnt mention seed bug anywhere
https://i.nuuls.com/cKLKO.png
well i can
original tbc had way bigger playerbase tho
and EJ was top of the top autists
seeds aoe cap was 13.8k in REAL tbc
not this dogshit we have in classic
bro
just because your average player was clueless doesnt mean EJ was clueless too
seed is bugged in classic tbc
wasnt in original tbc
simple as that
yes i do
dont think np procced when he died
but hes very unlucky if it works
we need to make a bug report on ptr
:peepohigh:
this is a bug
wait i think my screenshots are from different fights
yeah my screenshots are from different fights actually
did he have 3/3 nether protection
hes either extremely unlucky or FA doesnt proc it
its useful always
you can survive pretty long time with healthstone
"only"
🤡
hes wrong
you can tank like 4 hits from full hp
3x1 + 3x2k is 9k
thats 6 chances to proc
very unlucky to not proc, and FA hits dont happen at same time
if it didnt proc on first 6 hits
then you have still chance to proc on first 3k hit
but the problem is it doesnt seem to proc
but idk if this guy ran 3/3
https://i.nuuls.com/cn1Rg.png
https://i.nuuls.com/qkQUa.png
maybe it works or maybe he got extremely lucky
9 resists in a row
yeah could be that it just shows up as resists
and not immune on wcl
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/TJ76LMBphkx1Zfmq
yes it says for the beam
but are you saying he just happened to have 9 resists in a row
wipe 4 2:36
and exactly after NP fades
he starts taking dmg again
maybe FA cant proc NP
but NP removes FA dmg
looks like FA cant resist fully normally?
only NP lock and rogue(cloak of shadows?) had any resist
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/TJ76LMBphkx1Zfmq#type=damage-taken&boss=-3&difficulty=0&ability=40871
he resisted 30% of FA ticks
im pretty sure it works
@ved what fight was ity
looks like blizz doesnt hate locks after all
barely any locks are using NP on ptr
whats wrong with them
?
you can
you just dont take point in emberstorm
soul leech
its extra threat but whatever
pretty sure ES 1 > sp crit 1
its impossible to say if NP procs off FA
these locks could be using 1/3
barely any of them have it at all
yeah had to be FA i think
https://i.nuuls.com/9ZOUm.png
i think this proves it
nether protection works on FA
he was the only lock with NP
palas bubble also makes FA hits "resist" on wcl
https://i.nuuls.com/5EfsL.png
so its pretty much confirmed nether protection makes you immune to FA dmg
question is can FA proc it
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/TJ76LMBphkx1Zfmq#boss=-3&difficulty=0 @Aloysius
https://i.nuuls.com/RFe74.png
this is where he gets NP proc
it comes from being targeted with FA spell i think
maybe FA dmg cant proc it
not even a parse spec
shadow destro has higher highroll
its a meme spec
@Ryusei shadow destro seems to have higher highroll tho
dont think i missed any debuffs either
or buffs
im basing it on hildi sim
corr seems to be better always
even if going for highroll
but yeah the problem is pet just dies every fight
dont play it
play shadow destro
its barely worth it to curse anything in t5 atm
only big mobs
imagine using icon over quags
:peepohigh:
its not?
my only wish was fixed seed
:peepohigh:
How do i get this toy
https://i.nuuls.com/jyNY9.png
damn
what a transmog
https://i.nuuls.com/tFvsp.png
lmao
it just procced in OG
no?
literally worse threat
while taking more dmg
prot warrior is only good in full caster comps
so you dont need to run any dps warriors
can palas somehow tank mother
or is bear required for that
@Mentis because of silence
warrior can go full threat gear
but then hes squishier than bear
so whats the point
brings worse utility
(if you bring dps warriors)
take the player AND class
2x pala is doable if they can tank mother somehow
in full lock comp you go 2x palas+prot warrior
bro just run 10 splits for glaives
so fury stack can lose to warlock stack
report the seed bug too fellow warlock player
just do dailies?
farming t6 will be kino bros
every week people will have to do hyjal
EVERY WEEK
they will have to be carried by locks
ZD probably bigger but you want skull
are you sure?
its a heal
i dont think overheal does any threat tho
for the healer?
you dont go shoulders?
you go either channeled elements or vestments
if ur guild wont run vashj anymore, easy channeled elements prio
yea most guilds will keep running vashj probably
its 10 min run for omega bis loots
looks like EJ was right
:peepohigh:
no?
haste is same as more dmg %
literally
on warlock
you have 1% haste you do 1% more dmg
yes more casts means spriests have less impact on isb
= more isb uptime
pure haste > orange
(total dps)
shadow is better with more gear
in next phase shadow lock outscales fire
no one assumes 90% isb
85% is normal
70% is omega low
75% is low
surely vestments drop today
already saw one drop this week
right guys
what?
spriests get t6 way after EVERY lock
locks got 2 loots in t5
while carrying raids
???
🤡
you prio 4pc to one prot pala then locks
OR 4pc to all locks then prot pala
no they didnt?
locks got 2 pieces
3 if you include neck
and locks buff spriests
https://i.nuuls.com/Tu0sB.png
this is my current gear
tell me what gear did i get?
bracers+wand
pants was free roll
and locks buffed spriest all tier
keeping soulstone on spriest
because they suicide all the itme
what full bis?
most loot locks want is uncontested
thats full grief
why would you grief the raid?
problem is if you give locks 4pc t6
raids become easier
if you give spriest loot nothing changes
yes they become even easier
best way to show love is giving loot to right classes so raid goes faster
no? i played fury
because i dont grief the raid
yea give him ZD and cuck EVERY lock
ZD is 1/5
you will be seeing them a lot
@spoar ok thats based
sure some people are fine with griefing the raid
fix the fucking seed bug
WHAT THE FUCK BLIZZARD
IM LOSING 2k DMG PER SEED CAST
blizzard fixed clockwork rocket bot instantly
surely they will fix seed too???
@Mentis it wasnt in christmas gifts at first
someone did forum post and was instantly fixed
https://tbc.wowhead.com/blue-tracker/topic/eu/clockwork-rocket-bot-winter-veil-gift-333037
vestments didnt drop ofc
:Pepeclown:
Bro EJ said cap is 13.8k
it WAS 13.8k
simple as that
if it was bugged
EJ would have done something and got it fixed
old blizzard cared
and did bug fixes
it is actual bug tho
full haste is bis
:peepohigh:
most warlocks will have toc before swp
even if they take ZD
haste ring most likely
youll be lucky if you see one drop
doesnt change the fact that trash epics are rare
how do we get seed fixed? :peepohigh:
it is broken tho
what evidence?
its broken
aoe cap is 13.580
EJ says aoe cap is 13580
AOE CAP IS 13580
and?
blizz should fix it
useful how?
blizz is lazy dogshit company
who wont fix gamebreaking bugs
its not on us
its blizzards job to fix it
its not working as intended
its broken
we dont need to support our claims more
EJ says aoe cap is 13580
ur talking about blizz?
okay i found this
https://i.nuuls.com/Q87QH.png
from this youtube video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj_IXTuS664&ab_channel=LeafyBlade
seed does dmg to 23 targets
13580/23 = 590
theres also another seed pop
didnt check that yet
or the most likely explanation: seed wasnt broken in original tbc
because if it was it would have been fixed
why didnt anyone use msbt in original tbc
really hard to see aoe cap from these old videos
when they dont use msbt
there are multiple original tbc seed videos
none of them seem to use msbt tho
boys
vestments dropped
for me
T6 was supposed to be out day 1
blizz fucked us
4 months of ZA WILL be fun
warlocks will be OMEGA top dps
and then they added OP pvp gear
what the fuck blizzard
problem is
people queue AV 4 weeks
and they get naxx bis gear
are haste gems in ptr
IS SEED BUGGED IN PTR?
shadow literally sims better in t6 bis
and fire requires you to run a mage
@Ryusei im pretty sure he didnt prove anything wrong
????
people still dont understand haste
how the fuck is this possible
on AVERAGE haste works always
and movement doesnt magically devalue haste
it allows you to start casting sooner after instant like life tap
p1 & p2 fire was best
p3+ shadow is best
its that simple
so if full haste gem is big IF
is gemming hit and crit a big IF too?
lets say gemming haste allows you to do 6 shadow bolts instead of 5
thats already a massive dps gain over sp gems
problem is people STILL dont understand haste
its 2021
soon 2022
ON AVERAGE 1% HASTE = 1% MORE CASTS
ITS THAT SIMPLE
@AlexTheSeal so whats ur take on NP proccing on FA
seems like you know everything
yeah bro listening to me is fairly bad bro
:Pepeclown:
fire was way better p1 & p2
saying anything else is pure cope
just like saying fire is best p3+ is pure cope
it was better tho
no one cares about parses bro
PS is worthless tho
you take it because you run 3 mages
and 8 locks
thing is lock stack doesnt need that much healing
maybe they dont want to exploit and maybe get logs disqualified
when disc priest works just fine with lock stack
how do you prevent oneshots?
🤡
they are oneshots because they oneshot
@Aloysius ok bro
how do you prevent an oneshot
how do you know when oneshot is going to happen?
you dont push hydross to 500% tho
palas dont have any defensive CDs?
it wont be
pala tanks it
yea its oneshot bro
looks like hes running 5 PS priests and druid tank
would be fun to check if any of those pain suppressions did anything at all
but cba
nah its just added bonus
why not if you dont need holy healing
its free dps
theres 0 reason to double pull platform pack
its aoe capped anyway
its not tho
you lose too much sp for it to be worth it on single target
on aoe why bother
just equip / un equip out of combat
not wrong
hes wrong
dont grief urself
yeah using worse consumables for hard progression makes sense ofc
https://preview.redd.it/ap3sypq26v781.png?width=2576&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d11a4979f104d289e47485bff9a0331de968e11
do furies really only sim 3.1k in swp bis?
yeah fury copers arent coping at all
no way they sim only 3.1k in swp bis
:peepohigh:
thats omega low
when locks sim 3.6k
dw scales with gear
rampage scales with nothing
who cares about fury copers
https://i.nuuls.com/fTGC6.png
lusts lock only in swp
:pepebrain:
are u high?
warlock is godlike
and cba to spend 1k per raid
just so i can lose to warlocks
but dont worry
always need one sunder/demo bot
furys need to do like 20 flask/elixir switches in bt
haste pots
scrolls
meanwhile warlock drinks 30g flask
and 1.5g mana pots
cant even use sappers most of the time
because of range issues
and thats why we call them fury copers
MRP was 150g ?
hopefully you have 50 stacks of flasks too
most of the trash isnt demon/UD
and all this so you can lose to warlocks
thats some pure cope
you bring enha because most melee classes arent viable without it
and most raids run melee classes for loot distribution reasons
healer cloak is lock bis anyway
:peepohigh:
(in vestments setup)
yeah mages want bracers+belt
oh and toc ofc
and then get cut in swp
fun times
it is a bad decision tho
casual guilds cant afford losing locks
not that any guild can afford that
but especially not casual guilds
lock is the hardest class to play optimally tho
yea bro
pressing hs/cleave +bt + ww is real hard
i said playing optimally
switching gear sets, not dying on trash
do they lose as much as we if we fuck it up?
no?
is it as big gain for other classes ?
no
it is harder
bowiz switches etc
seeding right target
ABC
false
sometimes you have threat issues
bro thats how you have oblivion on bosses
this is why lock is the hardest class
dont
its too late
dont give mages a chance to steal all ur loot
next fres
fresh
how do people even get banned from class discords
:peepohigh:
bael isnt it fbf
why are you here
when are we getting enslave demon dmg added to warlocks
kihra hates us
feels more impactful
ur way less aoe capped
and locks dont even have different category for tank locks / fire / shadow
:peepohigh:
kihra actually hates us
meme spec so fury copers can compete with real classes
well imp FF is like 20 dps for them
its a speedrun meme
but speedruns should use lock stack anyway
so its full cope
so why bring imp ff at all
you dont need it
they want glaives
i dont think they care about flurry
problem is sim undervalues haste
:peepohigh:
in speedrunning?
doubt that
you seed 5-6 times and then do instants while running
so seed is fixed @Ryusei ?
gotta go test this right now
:peepohigh:
wait a few minutes
ill go test it
:peepohigh:
im flying to netherstorm rn
3 minutes
ryusei said its fixed
:peepohigh:
yeah and now im testing it
if its still bugged or not
seed isnt fixed
:peepohigh:
dr boom
https://i.nuuls.com/7NKEn.png
9 hits * 1357
so seed was bugged in original tbc too
people just didnt notice?
:peepohigh:
it was bugged in 2008
:peepohigh:
we need to get it fixed
now we have proof it was bugged in original tbc too
time to get it fixed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qTJs4XOSyg&ab_channel=llmano
found this
but its pretty late
could be 2.4.3
atleast 2.4.0
did seed have different aoe cap earlier in tbc?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeYLLaRcWJI&ab_channel=apostropheondrugs
this dudes seeds are hitting way too low
3% crit must be way better
and dont need to run into melee range
that ui
:monkaS:
multidot classes werent at slight advantage
mobs were too spread
dragons are based
@Shaggydaggy thats a big dick pumper
if you do KT
you kill solarian too
KT neck is bis for most casters
no they dont?
KT neck is better than haste neck for most casters
for locks haste neck is only 3 dps ahead with epic gem
without epic gem its worse
in some setups yes
in some setups you use cloak for hit
not neck
its not always bis for locks bro
channeled elements bis setup uses nethervoid
and KT / haste neck
channeled elements is like 6 dps worse
i would unironically go for them if i didnt get vestments
lulek ?
our girl
fetish is almost impossible to use
prism just works
mage(s) ?
ur only forced to run one mage in BT
depends
prot pala might need spriest
hyjal speedruns will be the thing
pure dps race
why not 16
put prot pala+spriest+ something in the last grp
https://i.nuuls.com/I61Mx.png
this is hyjal comp
probably forced to run a mage in BT
idk if pala could somehow tank council caster
warlocks aoe is just as strong
while needing less support and doing more ST
:Pepeclown:
yeah mages with their massive 30 dps boost from t6
will be competing on meters
:Pepeclown:
dont worry we are forced to run mage in t6
not in swp tho
yeah bro i was just pretending to be retarded
:Pepeclown:
sure they will compete with every other no aoe class
bt trash is 99% aoe
palas will be MT tho
and there will be no threat problems for locks atleast
locks will do insane threat next phase tho
but pala should have no problems
you gain 800
if locks will have threat problems
furys cant press buttons at all
pally will be doing insane tps with t6
ZD is way better than bowiz for seeding
even if fight is fully aoe capped
and it never will be
pretty sure they do
@Lots thats normal haste right
not spell haste
so haste doesnt affect badnges
but affects channeled spells
locks are actually stronger on nerfed t5
because less taps
and less +8 mob pulls
and boss fight durations reduce tap amounts
leading to even higher dps
why wouldnt you do platforms
hunters need to not grief and nuke skull
fury cope is the best
when warlock is best scaling class
bros
mages finally figured out skull isnt good for them
they finally understood rep trinket is very good
you only hit 1.2 SB in swp bis
1.1s incinerate
shadow will be better next phase
shadow will be better
and doesnt need a mage in raid
allowing you to run 0 mage in swp
well you shouldnt have one
they will be worse locks
and if you have one even then shadow is better
3646 vs 3607 shadow vs fire
https://i.nuuls.com/C_Twi.png
with these realistic buffs?
doubt it
worse than mana pots
i said realistic buffs
with every lust we hit around 4.1k dps
so play will be chain lusting locks
https://i.nuuls.com/okL2N.png
realistic dps
:Pepeclown:
but dont worry fellow fury bros
fury sims 3k swp bis with glaives
thats pserver
its simple
you give lock bis loot
every lust
and they do 4.2k dps
problem is lock is better
petri strat will fail if they get ported on top of the raid
just use rocket boots
or just nuke it down
repeat until you get good rng
idk no one has tested probably
idk if you need to tap in next phase
expect on illidan
fights will be super quick
there are many breakpoints when cata is good
what if you have free taps but oomed right before them in fight
cata could have gave you many more shadow bolt casts
right now it doesnt really matter
immolate or cata but next phase cata is just better
immolate is nice to cast as 2nd global but thats it
whats the point of this discussion
this phase it doesnt matter
next phase you go catabolt
well imp searing is useless
so you dont that
yes really
its useless
then you do shadowburn into coil
and start tapping for next fight
who cares if it hits or not
you do that and then start tapping
why not
you can move while casting coil
???
its either shadowburn into taps
or shadowburn+coil into taps
WHILE RUNNING TO NEXT PACK
that massive 2.5k crit bro
:Pepeclown:
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/MYDWyKt49GzJxXnj#boss=-3&difficulty=0&type=damage-done&source=27
i was unlucky and it didnt crit
or it cant crit idk
but as you can see my searing pain was even lower hit
and thats with 5/5 emberstorm
pure grief
you go cata and NP
because why not
you always tank capernian?
why :peepohigh:
any lock can do it
and pretty sure you can tank leo with nether protection
capernian tanking was only worth it if you had someone apply dagger to it
pumpers were furies in classic tho
not warlocks
mages will stay arcane rest of the expansion
unlucky
mages bring int scrolls to raid
and welfare raid spot in BT because of council tanking
@Davos arcane mage was basically unviable before 2.4.3 changes to mana regen
imagine bowiz smuggling
:peepohigh:
no its bowiz smuggling
you smuggle in weapon switches
you dont weave anything
its only 800 dps below normal spec
its real
is seed fixed
are haste gems in
:peepohigh:
EU copy worked
during the last ptr
last p3 ptr
last ptr with crashes
eu copy worked
mages kinda need toc if they want to use noose
NA needs every handicap possible
if raid goes week 2
NA instantly wins for free
world first race isnt fair at all
will we be able to buy haste trinket with badges
if its in
@Blow nice enjoy ur 30 dps boost
toc wont get DE'd
mages and palas want it
locks want it for no ele situations
your raid has 2 locks and ur cucking them to toc?
thats smart
why is it player prio?
its omega bis for locks until KJ dagger
and its omega omega bis if they are coe/cor lockls
well its even more omega bis to locks
🤡
i dont overuse omega tho
how is it easier to transition
swp drops bis mh&OH
and mages actually use the hit
more haste = more isb
more bolts locks cast less spriest griefs isb uptime
its simple math
everything is marginal
but statement is still true
more haste = more isb
@Skycrab because jannies grief
oh they changed name change place
thought it was forced
@AlexTheSeal more haste is never less isb
haste = faster taps
haste = faster curses
haste = bis
@Ryusei wrong
haste cloak is bis for locks
and not bis for other classes
its literally 100 dps difference on aoe
and only way to scale coe/cor is haste
which doesnt show up on sim
giving ZD to locks in casual guilds is even more important
makes the game easier
@Blow you give ZD to locks and whole raid gets out of hyjal faster
which will be very important for casuals
christmas bot ribbon proc works in cities
atleast did for me
just remember every time imp dies its 10s resummon
you cant chain drums
lmao they fixed ribbon?
but not seed bug thats been ingame for 15 years
because blizz hates locks
sp not applying misery is pretty big loss
threat actually matters on VR
you should especially use ES on tanks there
its more threat
vs less threat
pushback isnt a big deal on VR tho
its not monka tapping?
you always survive if you were topped
its not impossible
depends how much spriests want it
160 is doable with belt+bracers+shoulders+2x rings
if spriests want it ofc
why not?
if haste is such a good stat
so why go for ZD
instead of pvp dagger/mace+badge OH
which is a lot more sp
pvp mace+OH is 298 sp
vs zhardooms 259 sp
259+49.5 = 308.5
so its 10 sp value difference?
vs free loot piece
now lets compare warlocks
fang+oh vs ZD
no you dont
because mages+palas want TOc
its not a free loot
if you run "normal" comp its 2 mages+1-2 palas
and toc is bis whole game for prot palas
first haste rings should go to locks
then give everyone else 1x
then 2nd one to locks first again
lock gains more dps tho
especially if they are on coe/cor
which every lock should be on trash
and this is st dps only btw
not even talking about seed dps
on sim?
with infinite mana im assuming
ele shaman is the last support last you cut from the raid
before you cut ele shaman you have already removed spriest,mages,holy palas,retri palas,hunters,warriors
holy weaving is just fine
not ids misery
it doesnt work
3/5 misery
ehh owl is actually pretty good unless you run full caster comp
@Ryusei because mages are good now
if mages arent good 0 reason to run spriest
instead of holy weaver
mages benefit a lot from spriest mana
how do you define shit?
dreamstate is absolute fucking dogshit
compared to holy weaver
you dont swap ele to resto next phase
wtf
if you want more resto shamans you cut druids/priests
only progress run was decent
other runs were minutes behind
https://i.nuuls.com/xovEm.png
0 competition tier because some guilds decided to run meme comps
you dont drop ele next phase
infact you never drop it unless you run healer ele shaman
healing in ele spec
@Davidhow they are comparing ZD to toc which is mage & prot pala bis
we should be passing on it for them
lie?
toc+chronicle is better than ZD for mages
does it have skull?
https://i.nuuls.com/Tw5Nq.png
left is ZD
right is toc
which is better?
looks like i was right
and infact toc+chronicle is better than ZD for mages
because mages dont get skull?
yeah bis is toc+chronicle
idk whats the problem mage players
very few bosses were hitting hard
bloodwill tanked stuff no problem on ptr
and he had scuffed gear
yeah gorefiend was one of the mobs who were hitting hard
but idk if they were using shit like tc+demo
and he had scuffed gear
@ved should i post his vod if its still up
so we can see i was right once again
https://i.nuuls.com/Nw3vM.png
https://i.nuuls.com/Nw3vM.png
and bloodwill was on scuffed gear pala
in scuffed raid grp
if feral tanks it
literally wont be any problems
so is affli worth running week 1? probably not
because bosses dont hit that hard
morogrim probably hits harder than anything in bt
but havent looked into this so could be wrong
i said probably
i watched bloodwills ptr stream
enough proof for me
sure he can but why would he
better to have destro tanking
destro doesnt need to just spam sp
desto does 1-2 searing pains and then shadow bolts
theres a reason why best speedrun guild runs 8 locks and 3 mages atm
in the phase when locks are weakest compared to mages
:peepohigh:
do we know if ptr will be up on sunday
fuck it just release t6 already
its ready
hf getting destroyed by glaive rogues
who paid millions of gold for them
which they bought with real money
gl
reckful got them in cataclysm
4-6% is the drop rate
theres no way its 10% for each glaive
and why are rogues discussing glaive drop rates anyway
i literally did 52 onyxias and didnt see a single DB drop
and its 8% drop chance
i did 28 BWLs before i saw my first crul drop
I actually got AQ axe before i ever saw a crul
well how many DSTs have you seen
since week 1
and its 14% drop chance
vs glaives 4-6% per one glaive
some people get it first raid
some people never
most people get it eventually
but we wont be raiding bt aslong as people did in original tbc
blizz is rushing tbc and releasing t6 way too late
TF was same
some people got it first reset
some people never
most people got it eventually
but thinking every fury in game will have glaives is pure fury cope
t6 > t3 > t4 > rest of the sets
simple as
t6 is so cool
especially on female belfs
belf is 2nd best lock racial bro
maybe even best if you include the looks
i would switch to belf instantly
free +10 sp
and t6 looks just too cool on them
https://i.nuuls.com/MGu2F.png
37 lvls to go
:pepehands:
maybe in sim
in real game where ur casting coe/cor haste is better
hildi sim has option to do 2-3 coes before seeding?
its not 1 global
its many many globals during raid
belbis is bis
:peepohigh:
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=1703/crystal-basilisk-spine#comments
does this stack with everything?
@spoar does it?
:peepohigh:
yes?
on illidan?
ur trolling
10 sr is massive
bro?
10 sr
is very big
way better than hs on illidan
so it does stack?
perfect for illidan bro
you do need it tho
max hit is like 12k
70 from buff + 10 from spine could be enough
thats the point
on top of resistance flask
no its not?
tbh if rune can trigger NP its the play for mother
looks like first FA cast can proc NP too
so its 2x 30% chance to proc
we are looking at decent odds
or you can pop dark rune which is a dps gain btw
and have chance to take 0 dmg
im doing massive theorycrafting and people are just trolling
30 dps is bigger than most upgrades
@Aloysius 30% chance to take 0 dmg too
in the long run its worth it
you might die even if you hs
you dont want to use health stone instantly
you dont want to save pot cd
why wouldnt boots work
sure it might be delayed a bit but boots make you move faster
its a mechanic where you have to move
moving faster will make mechanic easier
its updatinmg
:monkaS:
is seed fixed
are haste gems in
not really
theres only one haste piece sharing oblivion slot
shoulders
@Ryusei haste cloak is better tho
atleast on my sim setup
https://i.nuuls.com/BLI56.png
i can export it
if you think half my setups are wrong

@Ryusei so half of my setups were wrong, can you tell me which ones?
@Ryusei you said half of my setups were wrong
can you tell me which ones
i even exported my sim
im genuinely interested
so i can fix my setup
and make crit cloak bis somehow
okay
so i was right
and you were wrong
got it
can you stop spreading misinformation then?
or atleast delete comment where you said half of my setups were wrong
okay
prove it
i posted my sim export
tell me whats wrong here
bro
ur saying half my setups are wron
based on 0 evidence
then i tell you to prove it
and you keep trolling
is having boomie in p3 unrealistic?
maybe it could be
but if we are cutting boomies why wouldnt you give haste cloak to locks
yeah im insane bro
so why were you saying crit cloak is bis
when it isnt
on channeled elements setup hit cloak is actually bis
but crit cloak is never bis
can you post your sim setup where crit cloak is bis
im genuinely interested how did you do it
yeah cant have wrong opinions
like posting sim where haste cloak is infact bis
even though people say it isnt
@Ryusei can you post export now? cba to go find them
exporting takes 5s
i posted my export
why cant he
when hes saying crit cloak is bis
okay how do i search it
from: ryusei and then what?
it takes 5s
surely you can help me here
oh so it wasnt 5s ?
okay
i was right again
what do you mean?
he said half my sim setups were wrong
i posted my export
and he didnt even check it
this is 202 hit setup?
with nethervoid cloak?
are you serious?
just slept 8h bro
dont worry
well on aoe haste cloak just destroys everything else
we should give crit cloak to other nonscaling classes
so they get something
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/gehennas/hannusumm
you tell me
its not tho
tbc warlock is way harder to play
than warrior
https://i.nuuls.com/8pZ5m.png
after ticking on custom isb and setting it to 85%
which is realistic
we are assuming chicken here
because you cut a boomie you should always give haste cloak to locks
and depends if holy weaver comes meta 85% should be baseline
it shouldnt change the value of crit
but it changes value of other stats
@spoar look at the dps of spriest
holy weaver brings same utility and heals
mage gets close to 0 upgrades
like locks did p1 -> p2
locks get the biggest powerspike in whole expansion
and?
why do you take a mage if lock deals more dps
(expect for council tanking)
120-160 is pretty realistic for next phase bosses
winterchill will be like 45s fight
its actually funny
lock skull prio isnt even a discussion
you always mana pot on lurker tho
on vashj p3 you dont go oom anymore i think
so should destro there
because i sit in water
no free taps
prot warrior is also the absolutely lowest dps in whole raid
while bringing basically 0 utility
2nd prot pala is just better in most cases
ele shaman 100%
its the last support class you cut
you cut spriest way before ele shaman
you just holy weave
works just fine
have to see how mother will work
can palas tank it at all
if they cant kinda need to have bear or prot
in hyjal you run 16 lock comp
already theorycrafted perfect comp
hyjal sounds way better raid to speedrun
its full pump
no special tactics just pure dps
dont worry with average luck ur going to finish first glaive set in swp
phys comps will be meta dont worry
illidan with melee stack sounds very monka
and locks gain massive benefit from low hp trash packs
no they dont
locks lose dps if they have to tap
no?
are u trolling
locks are way better than earlier in ssc
0 taps during packs
sola packs have too low hp
solarian packs are very small part of raid now
very very small
who cares
how much hp do solarian packs even have combined
like 200-300k
its literally nothing
locks dont lose anything from low hp trash
you do one curse then seed
if you die gotta look at adding more prot palas or sapper md hunters
technicians have 10k hp
theres what 15 of them in raid?
thats 150k
150k dmg in raid is nothing
murlocs / lurker packs have pretty much perfect hp for seeding now
i think bt will be around those maybe a bit more
AE is only better if there are many mobs
which is the reason mages lost a lot from post nerf
no more technicians to pad
most guilds also skip leo trash
atm
which is a big loss for aoe classes
like what?
lock is the best stackable class there is
needs 1.5 support classes
locks will top meters next phase
??? how does lack of CDs hurt locks
faster you go less CD uptime you would have anyway
if you go slow it doesnt matter
@Louki furys and arms have TC too
dont worry
doing coe/cor is big dps loss for warlocks
surely one fury can do TC
very good because 2x sappers
its 2x more CDs/sappers for trash packs
its the best way to speed up
phys comps need 3x blessings
do you really want to run holy pala
that holy pala could be holy weaver
@Louki are you speedrunning?
if you are speedrunning can you say ur not cutting a class
in speedrun you have to fun best comps if you want to compete
its simple as that
@Aloysius there were minutes differences
comps are very important
you need 25 good players + good comp if you want to compete
which is why progress won
yes you do
thats why progress won with 2mins
every minute is harder to gain
38:52 vs 40:34 is massive difference
in top retail guilds those good players have every class
was hunter shit?
he was top dps on sylvanas
warrior brings battle shout
thats why its used in retail

look at the dps difference
its not even funny
if they dragged more why weren they faster
why did they do less dmg in raid
coh isnt needed in lock stack
and they ran shit load of casters
IDS is pretty decent
they used PS on some bosses and pulls i think
druid is pretty good with double prot pala
not really if you run lock stack
4 healing melee comp is pretty hard
not really
and locks have 26% inc healing
which is very big
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/AJqcD7hdwHkZ4mrT#boss=-3&start=0&end=2332001&type=damage-taken
we can look at the dmg taken here
and remember locks get 26% more healing from fel armor
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/mnfrxPRKZ1WhLvX7#boss=-3&start=0&end=2434885&type=damage-taken
because most of that healing is free
no one is dying if you cant top off lock instantly out of combat
well healers pretty much have no mana problems right
on my realistic bis list
with realistic debuffs
haste cloak is bis
85% and no malediction
https://i.nuuls.com/fXFei.png
bro whats wrong with 50k iterations
🤡
and the biggest argument for haste cloak is trash dps anyway
no taps vs taps is pretty big difference
should give crit cloak to other classes
shadow cloak to spriest first
90% is pretty much never doable
because first shadow bolt is never ISB hit
if unlucky 2nd isnt either etc
caster KT weapon is actual dogshit
compared to every other weapon
melees get actual better glaives
disqualified logs btw
yeah melees get better glaives
casters get 30sp upgrade iirc
feels like they stealth buffed vestments drop rates
i got mine last week too
biggest impact will be 4pc t6 > ZD > skull
but skull will be omega bis rest of the game
yeah should go for skull for sure
no
it was bugged in original tbc too
just make resto go ele and heal
ele healers + holy weaver all lock needs
or just dont
bringing ele healer is way bigger dps increase than dreamstate druid
yes lock doesnt need ele
but should they have one?
yes
who else would you give hearts?
if you care about speed its lock prio
but in casual guilds it should go to locks
all that crit on ZD is wasted on spriests
unlucky
i think u guys should just take free weapon and OH
and take that 10 dps loss
no skull = NO LOCKS
gquit
no?
locks gain most from ZD&skull
in casual guilds its even more important to not lose locks
only if he main tanks
why would you prio ZD to eles/spriests/moonkins
lock gains more dps than all of them
skull is lock only item
ZD is lock prio
a lot of classes just want loot because its cool
more raid dps
we get out of raid faster if locks get ZD
its a win win
bael you should start shilling shadow weaving
would fix this problem
mind controlling wont be worth it
spriest will be applyin misery
its 20s duration
20s duration
its not worth it
and delay wave?
no i dont think so
🙏
are haste gems in
@Ryusei no problem
i dont care
are haste gems in
yellow haste gems arent on shatt vendor
lmao
yellow haste gems arent in
what is blizzard doing
????
https://i.nuuls.com/o-AXJ.png
they were from scaled sand rep too
atleast oranges are in
is anyone in hyjal? didnt actually check if orange haste recipes are on that vendor
are orange haste gems on hyjal vendor?
didnt check
seed bug is still in
:peepohigh:
blizzard actually hates locks
lmao
they removed all the haste gems
fucking dogshit company
Yeah no recipes in hyjal
on gem vendor yeah
on gem vendor yeah
but not in hyjal
oh well 20 dps loss because of haste gems
unlucky
blizz hates us
another great decision by blizzard
https://i.nuuls.com/shhbr.png
this is bis now probably
yeah more people wanting reds
thank god
wdym
there will be almost 0 supply for reds
not a single guild will be selling them
@Crimble tell them to go holy weaving
@Healspls https://i.nuuls.com/nKb9x.png
dont worry bro
we are going home
god i wish we get haste gems p3
:pepehands:
so its early?
cant make it
:pepehands:
oh could make it then maybe
1sp is more than 1 dps in t6
iirc 20sp was like 30 dps
shaman 2pc t4 is worth 29-30 dps
on my sim setup
im pretty sure he meant saturday
why does archimonde have 4.5m hp
did t6 release really have 4.5m hp archimonde
mother changes werent minor at all
pre nerf mother was insanely hard boss
lets go do MH
we dont need any support classes there
optimal hyjal comp is 16 locks
4 eles
holy weaver
bro archimonde has 4.5m
its lust & pump boss
if archi had 6m hp
you could argue he has mechanics
but 4.5m is literally lust & pump
and hes dead
whos our holy weaver
@Bael
does he have time to do those mechanics tho
locks will be pumping 3k dps
and add support classes
we are looking at 40-60k raid dps
you run out of fire?
thats a mechanic
?
lock discord raid needs holy weaver
we need to show the world its the meta
@Mentis unlucky timing cant sign
you need one mage for council
its forced welfare raid spot
it should be able to proc when mother targets you with FA
same
and does less threat
and higher range
pretty sure it doesnt beat channeled elements
and cowl setup doesnt have wings
so is set bonus from t6 more than 6%
does it work same way
it wont be relevant after this phase
next phase shadow is already equal / better dps
even personal
in full bis ofc
@Ryusei i got 10 dps difference by switching around neck / gems, but this setup requires way more red gems
and raid dps wise shadow will be better
only advantage fire has is flame caps are cheaper
BT fights are omega low duration
and will be very very very low with t6 gear
looking at 0 taps on most bosses
@Ryusei no i meant i got fire to be 10 dps better than 85% isb shadow
by switching to red gems instead of oranges
but dps difference could be easily because of that
i can fix the shadow setup to be omega greedy with gems
sec
lack of haste gems really cucks shadow
@Ryusei its the gem color issue
shadow setup needs hit bonuses from legs/gloves
@Ryusei yes infact having to use crit/sp gems instead of haste gems is loss of around 15-20 dps for shadow
fire needs to use less oranges
if you calculate in ISB uptime gain its not a big loss probably
everything is marginal
expect ZD & t6 set bonus
blizz removed them in latest ptr
so probably no haste gems
oranges in legs/gloves are 2 hit / 6 sp / 5 crit
hard to beat those stats
https://i.nuuls.com/shtPV.png
why do they get equal prio
locks aoe scales so good with haste
if the haste breakpoint is so massive (it isnt) for spriests
they should go for shoulders
basically even spriest discord tells people that 146 breakpoint isnt real
mad about doing more raid dps?
thats interesting
so yell at spriest to stop casting mind blast / death
or just go fire
instead of affli
fixes the low isb uptime problem
cant go :pepehands:
MH doesnt drop haste rings
give cloak to spriests
seed bug report post is removed?
mother is lust & pump boss
like every other boss in t6
archimonde has 4.5m hp
yap
pump & lust
isnt council pull just bubble mage and he spellsteals
tanks grab their targets
everything feels boring after lock
:peepohigh:
and we havent even got any upgrades in tbc yet
0 real item upgrades
well t6 4pc is massive
but locks deal basically same dps as we did in prebis
@JordanF https://i.nuuls.com/8IEmp.png
https://i.nuuls.com/MJXXX.png
difference between literal full prebis vs t5 bis
do you call this big difference?
is it?
how much did other classes gain dps from prebis vs t5 bis
it is tho
yes most of us were fire in p1
they wont be gaining 15%
their only big scaling was 2pc t5
will be worth it to use immolate for sure if ur specced
but most likely wont be
depends
if melees are apes and dont split dmg
then oblivion will be big loss
but if they play correctly oblivion will be good
epic gems do jackshit for seed set
if we dont get haste gems
its 8 crit vs 10 crit
and yellows will be free after mages have them
so you could just epic gem oblivion set
bis seed set this phase will be haste shoulders + other pieces oblivion
@Bnanners well do you have tailoring
well then yes
im planning on switching to tailoring from engi, crafting shoulders and switching back to engi
in ZA patch you can wear haste piece in pretty much every slot
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/4Ghwo91cX83ubha2mGyJbN
ZA patch seed set
820 sp
low hp trash means we dont need to coe
if mob has 150k health
and ur seed does 13k
nah
just precast seed and pray
or youll lose to other classes
dont worry fellow mage
you have one welfare spot in bt
i have mage alchemy alt
i want my axe back
:peepohigh:
its just a alchemy alt
you would hit coe if mobs have enough hp
if mob has below 150-200k hp
its not worth it to curse over seeding
just dont have pings enabled
if those bother you
and this is massive gamebreaking bug we are talking aboyut
shouldnt this be posted to ptr forums too?
@Passion its a massive gamebreaking bug, we are literally losing 15% of our seed dps
bro ur literally losing 15% of ur aoe dps
and ur saying ping in class discord is dramatic?
@Blow wheres the holy weaver?
shouldnt u guys post this to ptr forums too?
imagine if any other class lost 15% of their dps
it would be fixed overnight
free expect it costs shit load of gold
any idea where all the macros are?
i want to move them from live to ptr
solarian morogrim
literally the only place
yea i copied my wtf folder but its my vanilla macros
is lockcord running holy weaver
we need to prove the world spriest isnt needed
BT is almost hard when everyone has 6k ping
is anyone else lagging super hard on ptr
in BT
its funny how he mentions self rez
when locks have that but at half CD
why are you running 0 eles but actual spriest
switch it to holy weaver and switch one resto to ele atleast
bro ur beyond cucked
no its way worse
skull / quags is way ahead everything else
but if you have infinite honor sure buy it
decent switch when skull is on cd
seed does pull aggro mid pull
id say maybe 1/10 ZD owners will ever replace it
most people wont even clear swp pre nerf
@Broski just because it was also broken in original tbc doesnt mean it shouldnt be fixed
that wasnt a bug
it was a feature
you dont need tailoring for shoulders
just craft them and switch
nah bliz hates locks
so they removed haste gems
vestments was always bis but channeled legs was very close
now channeled legs arent close at all
you drop engi
enchanting is very expensive to lvl
does any other classes aoe cap work like this?
no. its a bug
yes because the nthe spell works correctly
@slightlystoopid420 ZD is
doing ptr with my guild and thought lock raid was happening this morning
any way to remove this magic res buff on council
i already hate council
such a dogshit boss
250 res shield
actually destroys dps
might need to get spell pen somehow
cloak enchant atleast
idk
malande wont have magic shield when res is up?
@Ryusei spell shield is sometimes up at same time as resistance shield
just gotta dps through 250 res i think
get spell pen
well melees have +20% armor shield too
we need to fix this spell pen problem
:peepohigh:
enchant is 20
coe 88
do we need spell pen gear set for this boss
you dont need 250
coe reduces it by 88 already right
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=30884/hatefury-mantle
this with 2x spell pen gems
might be very good
How common is glaive actually
holy fuck
250 magic res is actually -50%
HOLY FUCK BLIZZARD
yeah spell pen setup will be 100% play for council
why did blizz make the spell aura -50% dmg
when phys aura is -20% dmg
?????
what is blizzard doing
does spellpen gem work on hildi sim?
doesnt seem to do anything on dps
Magic resistance and spell pen isnt working correctly on hildi sim
Fixing this would be good nice see because council has 250 magic resistance aura half of the fight
@Kristofer
why do mages get free welfare raid spot
why cant locks tank council with arcane res
yea
why blizzard
and why is council aura literal -50% magic dmg if no spell pen
eye of moam looks insane tbh
we just need to get working spell pen on hildi sim
swapping is too much work
very good spell pen shoulders too
but need to get sim working
very hard to feelscraft spell pen
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=30884/hatefury-mantle#comments
add 2x 13 spell pen gems to that
and its 49 spell pen from one piece
i wonder if moam is solo farmable
@GAMING WARLORD on council?
how much did u guys clear
why
its lust & pump boss
dont think ros had even any mechanics
i just presses shadow bolt
time to ban swd bros
its raid dps loss
i still have no idea what ros does
:peepohigh:
just sit there and dps
we did ros no problem today
???
why would you use shadow ward on ros
lust & pump
and lust
yea doing more dmg is toxic
:peepohigh:
i heard druids need to power shift
their rage away
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=22848/elixir-of-empowerment
bis council consumable btw
go empty AH from recipes while you can
already emptied gehennas
250 magic resistance aura
half of the fight
yes it does
coe removes already 88
and you can have adept's elixir
30+20+88
from enchant+elixir+coe
eye of the moam is bis trinket too
very good shoulders
mother is omega easy
people will struggle on council a bit
and on illidan a bit if you want full melee uptime on eles
nah council was way harder
but could be because we were 5 healing
if casters have low hp
they get oneshotted
so more mages / spriests you have harder it is
etc
council probably is the hardest fight this tier
nah
raid soon and ptr with guild after that
furies rly replace hunters
not warlocks
you can holy weave
spriest is only required for mages
I think for council play is to have 2nd chest with 3x spell pen gems
either t5 or t6
mother is free loot
just use rocket boots
why?
all true
mother is full rng
you can wipe with full sr and not wipe with 0 sr
its just rng
for illidan flask switch + spine might be enough
if it goes long
on top of a priest buff
its not 0 sr
its 70+35+10
no spine
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=1703/crystal-basilisk-spine
it stacks with everything afaik
bro
you dont hs anyway
locks need very minimal amount of SR anyway
use JC neck + something
more than enough
make a macro with hs+ shadow ward + jc neck
cant die
we discussing illi or mother?
@Skript for mother yeah
you do on mother
not on illi
seed is 30s right
idk if seed is better than spine on illi
@Klassisk craft shoulders and switch back to engi
thats what im planning to do
yeah
sim undervalues haste
:peepohigh:
my feelscraft says quags is way better
just dont move when quags is up
its simple
or do hasted taps
which are massive
boar's speed
or normal ms
engi is only good if ur speedrunner and need rocket boots
yea swp bosses have nice hp amounts
need 2x on everything and it would be hard
did u guys do hyjal?
Are you sure spell pen is working correctly? after coe+ cloak enchant 250 resistance seems to lower dps by 100
seems pretty low
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/2/2d/Magicdamagereduction.gif/revision/latest?cb=20070308155650
I dont know if this photo is correct but it should be reducing dmg done by around 25%, not 3% if mob has 142 resistance
https://i.nuuls.com/VPUr_.png
This was with coe + spell pen enchant
Looks like i have 84 spell pen with 0 items / buffs / coe that should affect it
I think i found the problem, skull seems to give 84 spell pen
@Kristofer
10 res is good on illidan tanking
no reason to not use it
neck is used mainly when seeding
and you dont want 12sp gem when ur seeding
warlocks have way bigger hp pool
and 26% inc healing
have spriests even calculated if using death is dps gain
considering it lowers isb uptime
its decent
if you have 30k honor points sure go for it
its not worthless
you could get extra seeds if you had haste
people still dont understand haste?
so do you guys not gear hit and crit either?
both of those stats could not work
only stack sp?
but sp could not work too
if you resist
what stat does anything for you?
if its 2 global fight
it could not
because maybe you would crit everything anyway, or you could crit 0
no its not
its just as big as always
anyone got 4pc t6 yet
and tested it?=
if its base dmg im quitting
so spec is dog during hardest phase
real smart
its dog
compared to normal destro
nuking him is way easier than doing demon phase
!doubleit
2x hp on everything in bt would be fun
originally hyjal was out day 1
and we would still be in season 1
anyone got 4pc t6 yet
we need to test it asap
base dmg 4pc = quit
you can do belf packs with pala+lock+healer
no problem
4pc will be base dmg
:peepohigh:
we saw one drop on mother trash
@Healspls even if it stacked meta would be warlocks
melee buff is the biggest meme i have ever seen
it literally makes you kill the waves slower
skull is lock only item
its simple as that
wtf
toc is mage item
and prot pala
mages dont even want infinity
wtf is wrong with u guys
so?
hes not a lock
and?
let him want it
doesnt mean you need to give him
you always have a choice
gquit
its not over loot
ur guild is clearly corrupted loot council
so just gquit
find a real guild
skull is lock only item
if hes a good player he shouldnt want skull
or use pvp weapon over toc
so hes dogshit player then
not good
resistance after week 1 is a meme
almost a meme week 1
yesterday actually
most people didnt even have jc neck
its not rng if people have necks + boots
@GAMING WARLORD wdym im hard farming mages with 0 pieces of t6 loot
give devastation to meme classes
wrong
hyjal packs wont die perfectly all at same time
and crit is very low value for seeding
oblivion + haste shoulders is bis
ribbon was a meme anyway
haste ring doesnt drop in hyjal
i would go for helm
no way ur clearing much bt in 3h
after hyjal
im always right
more haste = more isb
all you need to know
head is decent but no wings
so you cant rly use it
yeah
if you use illidan head you wont get wings
so you cant use illidan head
council and illidan will be hard for some guilds
you just blast through 250 aura
get spell pen
guys why doesnt illidan reset threat
when we phase it in demon phase
anyone tested t6 4pc yet?
:peepohigh:
is it base dmg
or total dmg
illidan actually free after p2
pretty sure you need to push him before rp starts
you cant push it during demon phase
just gotta afk 1 min
push it before or after demon phase
people will get used to this difficulty
and then swp will hard filter most guilds
leading to early nerfs
bloodboils is literally not a mechanic if you rotate it
bloodboil does nothing
its not even a mechanic
no point rly
might aswell do rotation
its free taps
so any news on t6 release
pretty much every guild already cleared it on ptre
time to release
we are missing so many resets rn
:peepohigh:
i could have gotten skull already
????????
why wouldnt they work in shatt
WHAT THE FUCK BLIZZARD
it must be a bug if they dont work
:peepohigh:
wings arent on always??
wtf
how are you 4th on ZD and 3rd on skull
should be like 2nd on Zd atleast
not many people will clear swp prenerf
allies eternally btfod
ofc mages stay arcane in swp
why would they take locks gear
@Blow what do you mean?
yes more dps is faster raid
anyone killed leo in rp event?
demon doesnt disappear
:peepohigh:
yea and 3.4m hp
its not tho
so anyone got 4pc t6?
:peepohigh:
they arent
they go for t6 legs tho
nice one bro
why would it be in
and everything else removed
no
more haste = more dps
simple as that
like 2-3h
BT is maybe 90 mins if you skip everything
yes remember to vote no chickens
its only fair
seed still broken
where does it say its pvp only change???
blizz hates locks
unlucky
@JordanF i tanked it no problem with 232 buffed iirc
whole demon phase
didnt want to wear more resistance gear
it cant tho
i think it hits like 10k
oh yeah was 271 buffed actually
https://i.nuuls.com/PINCy.png
what item
like they said?
time to stop coping
warlocks are losing 15% seed dmg
and blizz is doing nothing
be happy AE isnt doing -15% dmg
so did blizz shut down t6 raids yet?
remember when mages thought their class trinket is shit
its time to get badge nerfed guys
its OP like MQG was
whos making the forum post
you dont take skull tho
mages actually got way too cocky
OH NO NO NO NO NO
its not arena only?
they obviously say its global nerf
stop coping
its OP and should be nerfed
and now they should nerf chicken & badge
@GAMING WARLORD you should focus on trying to get badge nerfed too
3x drops from solarian etc i think
mark of the illidari
#NERFBADGE
NERF BADGE
NERF CHICKEN
FIX SEED
leaving seed broken is most retarded thing
it is tho
it cant hurt locks
all lock trinkets are absolute dogshit
we did
blizz literally doesnt give a fuck
jpaint is a mage player?
undercover?
mage wont be top
BT packs favor locks hard
6 mobs is perfect for lock
@tiro no it was bugged in original tbc too
mages actually got way too cocky
they thought they would be top dps rest of the expansion
mother is easy
nah
illidan requires people to have brains
so might be hard for some guilds
just dont push him in demon phase and its free
why would you warrior tank illidan
when pala can do it
pala tanked it no problem
just demo shout and thunderclap
whats early enrage?
pala is just superior mt in t6
idk if bear is required for swp but probably not
yeah thats dutch food bro
no one else eats mashed potatoes with vegetables
add high fructose corn syrup to everything
how do you define culture?
if CPC decided earth was flat every chinese people would think that
who ever is running this simulation doesnt need to use birds as drones tho
wdym
are you implying this isnt a simulation?
imagine being fine with having all ur privileges taken away
:peepohigh:
we lost
schizopost?
are u okay bro
its always bis if you care about speed
speedruns will wear necks
and rocket boots
yeah most people reset it
probably fucks it up
faster
killing healer is cancer
no you pull healer away
kill 2 adds+boss
and then reset the healer
so it disappears
u sure?
why so low kill % then
so they pulled slowly
who cares
low hp amounts on trash benefit locks more
dont need to tap at all in combat
t6 chest is bis looks
i kinda wish i didnt get vestments
channeled elements is non vestments lock prio if guild stops running vashj
cowl = no wings
fetish is dog
prism is good
fetish is good if you drink 30s between every pack
yeah locks are better in bt on aoe
6 mobs is very good for locks
and 0 taps
this is why i always say mages got way too cocky
remember hunters in p1?
oh no no no
its almost sad
mages got way too cocky
hyjal favors mages for sure
very big packs
but BT is mainly 4-6 mobs
leo jump isnt a meme tho
thats the standard behaviour?
haste cloak does literally nothing on healers
if you give it to a lock you get out of the raid faster
no skull = no locks
simple as that
no zd = no cor
??? why would moonkin and ele want healer cloak
they dont have any aoe capped spells
warlock is the only class that hits aoe cap realistically
because crit cloak is just as good for them
probably?
dogshit channel bro
they called me "anti vaxxer"
i denied it
all the mage shills
hating the only true lock
2992 1 lust, 3151 2 lusts
every lust is pretty much 150 dps per lock on 3 min fight
3080 1 lust, 3323 2 lusts
120-160  is realistic for most fights
illidan is a bit longer
in speedruns you lust one warlock grp on elemental phase and then lust everyone in p3
if lusts are up ofc
you cant push him in demon phase
under 30%
well you can but threat wont reset
dps gain from t6 will be insane
bosses will die so quick in a month
@Blow no you will misery every mob
no time to holy nova
how much dmg does one nova do?
bro ur trolling
no scaling?
thats now how warlock rotation works
you dont gain anything
immolate just deals more dmg than incinerate
so you cast it when its not up
and you shouldnt even be fire lock in next phase
@Myrise it doesnt matter really because immolate is better spell than incinerate
catabolt is the spec next phase
if ur not playing it ur griefing
shadow is better spec tho
ur actually griefing if ur fire next phase
not wrong
i can post my sim setups again
and cba to switch sacs all the time
AND shadow gets nether protection
which is pretty good
even in hyjal you want shadow sac
unless ur grp kills every mob perfectly at same time
everything i just said is 100% true btw
and no one can even argue
@Caesar fire and shadow personal dps difference is about 8 dps in my sim setups
boosting spriests dmg alone makes shadow way better raid dps
and you dont need to switch sacs
AND YOU GET NETHER PROTECTION
and supremus has fire resistance
idk if illidan demons have fire res or are immune to it
did anyone test
normal raids? 4
sometimes
we are running 3 comps atm and 2 boomkins
ur talking about isb uptime? 85% is very realistic next phase
@King Hayek was he a mage? :peepohigh:
you can smuggle it with instants but its not worth it
just use bowiz when seeding with oblivion set
ptr is still up?
its the dog healer trinket + shield
enjoy
every week
isnt it weapon + other stuff loot tables
so dagger+  shield cant drop
so can ZD & skull drop at same time
no one will be cutting eles tho
meta will be warlocks
@wafy its still 3% crit and there are far worse classes
like spriest
if you are talking about cutting ele you should have already cut spriest
you run holy weaver
are you a speedrun guild?
most raids dont benefit anything from cutting a boomie
no they dont
loss of imp ff,6% crit on locks,innervate,combat rezz is pretty big for casual guilds
on st? barely
its very close on st but on aoe ofc extra lock is better
boomies get a lot of stuff from t6 too
their trinket looks pretty good
t6 looks pretty good
literally doesnt on fire
not a single "top guild" runs affli in non caster stack
more haste = more isb
dont believe spriest/mage propaganda
fire locks were better in p2
but in t6 gear shadow lock outscales it
no?
are u trolling
@Ryusei so ur saying literally every speedrun wont be shadow in bt?
@Foolipe wait its only 100 dps better when aoe capped?
OH NO NO NO mage bros...
so when do u guys cap?
locks cap at 6-7 realistically
did chicken get banned
wtf
why didnt more people vote to ban it
:peepohigh:
yeah bro chicken abusers arent autistic
im the autistic one who doesnt do it
and wants to get it removed
sure you will buddy
blizz actually cares about classic
and isnt just milking everyone
why do mages care about akama padding anyway
locks seed them down in 10s
so we wont be getting s3 haste items until sunwell?
why did we get s2 gear before black temple then
whats going on blizzard ?
healer parses :peepohigh:
ur joking
shamans dont understand they bring lust & totems ?
priests will NEVER compete
you cant call it a boss
you press seed a bit and then kill boss in 30s
@Healspls slows down the packs you mean
pretty much yeah
its easy to check details
if spriest dies
you go check did he die because of death
palas get the dildo
spriests get the dildo
whats the problem
weapon just doesnt proc
if it wasnt absolute dogshit fury copers would force someone to use it
@Healspls no? never played tbc pservers
and never was in return
you dont go for anetherons
you go for haste belt now
not really?
if you use night use haste belt
if you use owl use bob
if you dont use jc neck use ros neck
locks should go for oranges anyway
well on bob / vestments you could go full reds
but in other pieces its grief
that clicking speed doesnt seem good
will get a lot of gaps
might want to speed it up a bit
maybe immune to cot
But is she immune to coe?
its called catabolt
so will we get chromatic flask instantly on next reset?
you do on mother for sure
and on illidan tanking you use it ofc
on illidan if you have decent raid dps you actually cant dps during demon phase
getting it from flask is so easy compared to items / gems
equip jc neck / rocket boots / pop resistance flask and ur done
cba
just drink resistance flask first week
jannies running wild here
:peepohigh:
flasks will be actually free with marks i think
you need rep?
oh thats good
mark flasks will be omega cheap
Exalted with Sha'tar, Cenarion and Scryers/Aldors.
ZD is biggest increase for locks from p2 bis
dont compare it to toc because toc is mage and prot pala bis
its the biggest one item upgrade for locks in p3
skull will be better in swp tho i think
first haste ring is like 40
ZD is 80
@Scanlawn so where do u gear the missing hit
you wont be using bob next phase
so where do you get the hit
mages will be missing hit tho
unless they have skull ofc
t6 is just as good for mages
oh so now ur going to gem hit?
instead of just taking better weapon
BT is mainly 6 mobs
oblivion will be very good in bt
haste shoulders is bis
eye+skull
eye+ tlc
CSD or gemming is too hard
difference is skull is lock item
why wouldnt ele sham be worth it?
who started this meme
holy weaving is viable trho
in speedruns
problem with toc+chronicle is it does literally nothing for seeding
if seed scaled from sp or crit i wouldnt mind it
but it only scales from haste
bro didnt u say earlier holy nova hits 285 per mob
no
mages first
pala gets trash mace which is very good
wdym scanlaw
why would that matter
how?
im still using badge OH
why does it matter that i got fang
mage whos going to get toc
for "progression" ?
what about fang+oh ?
after t5 nerfs you barely have to use coe/cor
only mobs with +200k should be cursed
thats basically what every politician does
isnt hxh better for spriests
timbals + hxh is realistic for spriests
sliver is lock item sry
when mages are barely hitting 3k in swp
and locks are doing 4k im thinking its lock item
with chainlusts yes
they do tho
you doom early for threat
stop trolling
yes you do
you did math on sb critting and pulling aggro?
nice one
like i said
you do curse into shadow bolts
you dont wait
no you wouldnt
no you wouldnt
you wait for lust which usually comes around 5-10s
after all debuffs are on
unless fight is exactly around 2min 20s
so what do you do first 5s of fight
just afk because you dont want to doom?
ok so how do you start fight then
tell me
md might not be up
1-2 hunters is meta
how does tank hold threat when you have shot 2x 8-10k shadow bolts in first 4s
you pull aggro
and thats why you start with curse
why would you use corr when shadow bolt deals shit load more dmg
so just start with doom into shadow bolts
you dont want to be casting agony if you could cast doom
did people stop speedrunning bwl and start speedrunning ZG?
why would tbc be different
https://i.nuuls.com/iWFPM.png
love mage discord
just stagger cooldowns for 2 mins and ZD is 1 dps better
:Pepeclown:
@Fira he stole it for strat gear
:peepohigh:
was the haste trinket in on latest ptr patch?
bros im so hyped
this mega corporation bought another mega corporation
70 billion is nothing for activision
that 13b was what 10 years ago?
its nothing to todays 70b
t5 bosses will drop extra loot next reset?
like 3 items from solarian
extra tier is literally worthless
better drop extra normal items too
all the alts are already full geared
they really should fucking add extra non tier loot too
does kt/vashj drop extra items too
or only tier
So do thornlings work on mother?
incubus are rapists
so blizzard felt like they need to add them
maybe we should report seed bug to microsoft
surely they would fix it
:pepe_ok:
just accept the fact that ZD is lock prio
haste rings are lock prio
and we are cool
did they forget locks do cor/ coe?
which ONLY scales from haste
when spriests aoe scale from spell power mainly
and yeah priests will be using boed on trash mostly anyway
!jpaint
why is jpaint pic removed
70B is nothing bro
its 2022
bro whats up with this sr discussion
use jc neck
use flask
use rocket boots
ur good to go
priests literally dont even use ZD on trash
its wasted
haste pvp items are not in
arp pvp items are in
FUCK WARLOCKS
surely haste gems will be in too
wdym
holy nova seems bis for trash
it even griefs mages
literal perfect
wdym finite casts
just stack crit and spell power and int
we should still have s1 gear
s2 was released during bt
blizz really hates warlocks
unlucky
t6 will be base dmg btw
seed was bugged in original tbc
and is bugged now
good thing is we dont really hit aoe cap in BT most of the time
its 6 mob pulls
where warlock is omega bis
yes its pretty simple question
seed isnt working fine?
werent all battlemaster trinkets released at same time?
now that MQG got fixed time to fix seed
wands
is seed fixed?
@JordanF no they wont
they hate warlocks so much that they just ignore us
i think they might mean solarian wand
so fellow warlock gamers
any idea why arp items are in
but not haste?
has any na gamer tested seed
and are Resistance flasks in on NA?
@JordanF did non tier bosses drop 3 loots?
are netherwing dailies out already?
do i need to buy epic flying
pretty sure it doesnt
and has the guy who tested netherwing done the prequest
?
they havent fixed a literal gamebreaking bug after 10000 bug reports
multiple forum posts
multiple youtube videos
company is fucking broken
so vashj has higher chance to drop vestments now?
so is resistance flask in or not?
in what patch was arp ring added
What?
its not
you only replace it with KJ dagger
which you might never see
some people wont even clear swp
magisters staff
🤡
stop bro
toc+heart of the pit is close one
but not beating ZD maybe
no smart locks dont grief their raid and take ZD
no one has tested seed yet?
:peepohigh:
tfw pepe's drop instead of shadow dmg cloak
:FeelsEnchantMan:
no its a sticker
couldnt copy it or anything
bro thats 3 mobs?
ur supposed to test it on dr boom
you need like 7-8 targets
its not tho
thats the other bug its not a big deal
imagine even doing the incubus quest
not based at all
:peepohigh:
@jan217 whats the name of item
what the fuck?
35 resistance flask isnt in?
What is blizzard doing
it was added in 2.1 ?
haste gems are in
surely
they readded them :copium:
@Davos dont worry they do literally same st dps as you do in full p2 bis
p1 p2 gear difference is literally few sp and a bit of crit
its a meme
can you prestack it?
and is that 5 dps better assuming you prestack it
everyone wears quags
1:20 will be easily doable 1-2 months into t6
dps gains will be insane
yes AD is broken because it would be good for warlocks
chicken works perfectly tho and has even exploit which makes it proc always
and blizz does nothing
blizz hates warlocks
you want to use flask for tanking atleast
spine is +10
flask + spine is 45 already
neck is 85 with those
bracers 125
boots and its 179
with boots+bracers+neck+flask+spine
https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=1703/crystal-basilisk-spine
it shares cd with healthstones
its worth it on illidan
you either get healed or you dont
healthstone wont save you
you just get enough sr to avoid 100% dmg hits
it deals around 6-8k with 174 res unbuffed max
https://i.nuuls.com/2l_-P.png
this was with around 180 unbuffed
you will only need sr for first few weeks anyway
1-2 resets and you wont ever see demon phase
@Altcode was dropping on ptr atleast
13k hp is very doable with t6 gear
dont worry about it
thats the answer
https://i.nuuls.com/MAgkJ.png
surely blizzard will see this
does magtheridons bag still drop epic gems?
dont see any in AH
it was giving epic gems yesterday on NA right?
new bags
saw it last week but idk if it drops 2x loot
didnt kill him
yes but did people get them out of mag bag yesterday
on NA?
old bags dont work im pretty sure
crit set in MH most likely and oblivion in BT
haste > crit > int
but if half of the pack dies sooner than other half oblivion gains value
haste always gains value when seeding
its the only real way to scale seed
stacking int doesnt mean you dont have to tap at all
yeah less aoe classes longer its going to take
which means locks deal less dmg
which means waves takes even longer
doesnt affect vestments
non tier bosses drop extra loot
tier bosses drop extra tier
we need m2f succubus
vestments,wand and bracers in same ID
just get a new guild ID
almost everyone in our guild has a wand
Bro you can just check out which set does more dps
our mag didnt drop epic gems atleast
has anyone actually got them from magtheridons bag
21-44 is realistic imo
or something around that
60s is way too long
sextant is omega rare
we did ? @Bael
i can still see it i think
spriests just cant handle the truth
they think once they get ZD they start doing dmg
fury doesnt gain that much from short fights
they are best when fights are just above 3 mins
like 3:30
warlocks probably gain most from short fights
if those classes ahve 100% uptime on CDs sure its good fight
but mages have around 20s of CDs and fury 30s
3 min CD
if fight is 2.45 - 3 mins they are fucked
no taps is omega good for lock
so no one has got epic gems from mags bag yet?
so mag probably cant drop epic gems ?
or its rare
@Crimble this proves crit is useless stat
that might be avoidable
if you drag paladin guy 30 yards away from caster
imagine not using threat enchant
illidan doesnt reset threat if you push him under 30% in demon phase
gotta push it in human form
curse of weakness?
no
demo is better
wdym
demo does nothing when hes shooting shadow bolts
you have few seconds to apply demo before he starts hitting anything in last phase
cow is dog compared to specced demo shout
he doesnt start chasing anything
He starts hitting mt if you did it correctly
bro
making it way too big deal
warriors apply demo
illidan is dead
try to do bt/ hyjal attunements
thats the only thing people will want for BT
@Michael you will lose to warlocks tho
and pay +1k per raid
bt ww cleave hs
demo if ur cucked
no they didnt
all good speedruns stacked warlocks for a reason
they wont catch up to t6 lock tho
this is when furys ST is strongest compared to locks
bt is perfect for locks
do u guys really care about parses on a single boss?
where its 5 chicken + reck
BT meta will be 8-13 warlocks
in speedruns
other classes literally cant even compete
its literally not tho?
are u trolling
all of trash is literally 6 mobs
if you dps caster theres no magic immunity or 250 res tho
they wont tho
pure fury cope
warlock will be #1
so ur saying top speedrun wont be 8-13 locks in bt?
if not more
okay
screencapped
not really
akama is perfect for locks
and its 30s fight who cares
so can locks
no one gives a fuck about parses
@KilLogic 20 sp isnt big upgrade
you dont cut ele shamans anyway
if you do you already cut all the support classes and are running holy weaver
you do
you run one mage for tanking
and thats in BT
which deals more dmg spriest+mage or holy weaver + 2 locks ?
i redpilled them on ZD
go check top speedruns and what class is most used
and BT will be even better raid than ssc/tk for locks
have you done bt stabile?
its mostly 6 mob packs
not really ?
no taps seeding is strongest aoe
low hp favors locks
it is on 6 mobs
whjat 2-3 mob packs?
u guys clearly have no idea about BT
its literal 10-15s of seeding per pack
which is perfect
you dont curse low hp mobs 🙂
which is big for locks
sun king simmed 2 dps better if you didnt use hit
but neck is very good place to get the hit
on seeding KT neck is way better
imagine if blizz didnt hate locks
and we got haste gems and neck
seventyupgrades thinks tear is swp bis
good website
hc player pulled yellow mobs?
thats fake
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/798264718988935189/933799671552442368/Screen_Shot_2022-01-19_at_1.png
what is this list
🤡
why isnt lock S on everything
🤡
@Davos priest discord
did you run exact fight length?
that kind of sim favors specific breakpoints
which make haste seem better than it is
its not even a conspiracy
everyone hates us
blizz wont even fix gamebreaking bugs
when they insta fix other classes if they lose even 0.1% dps
was it a nelf?
supremus has fire resistance
illidan demon are fire immune
shadow sims better
its over
resummoning 10s imp every pack is fun
:Pepeclown:
mag was peak demonology
if you did 5 stack channelers
ur cucked
giving ZD to spriest is basically disenchanting it
meme specs include mages btw
but dont worry one welfare raid spot in bt
because of council
arcane res doesnt work
:sadge:
thing is why would you run spriest when holy weaver brings literally same utility
and tank heals just fine
nah spriest is probably worth it currently
and always will be in casual comps
but t6 speedruns will be cutting them for sure
what else is there to discuss
most t6 bosses will die in under 2.30 min
no
male belf = no loot
mages using 5pc t2 is pure cope
what is there to discuss
locks already won
they are coping because locks can hit everything and they cant
unlucky
yes but is it worth it?
ur wearing t2 for pretty long time
you only hit more mobs very small duration of the fight
trash pack(s) before it, akama
locks already destroy the channelers in 10s
is it more dmg?
thats what im asking
if you want to wear 5pc t2 you gotta equip it 1-3 packs before akama
for very short duration aoe
is spoar another mage spy
succubus dies
felguard maybe dies
neither
he probably dies before he gets any casts off
what question
im asking
is it worth it
to use 5pc t2 for trash pack + akama
just so you can hit few more targets
in like 10s window
you wont be chain pulling those packs?
or just pulling them together
if ur not speedrunning why even care
zone in grab ur free loot sponsored by blizzard and dad gamers
spriest prio is biggest copium
spriest zd = disenchant
imagine not subsidizing farming
what do you eat if no one farms?
what do you eat if imports dont happen for some reason?
immo is good 2nd global
but never cast it in other cases
CHICKEN SHOULD BE BANNED
troll would be so insane racial
blizz really hates us
imagine t6 on female troll
and that haste racial
12k buffed?
thats normal in raid gear
atleast in t6 gear
i have 10.6k atm without optimizing for any stamina
soulguard bracers + belt and ur looking at 12k easily
you are tho if you equip sr belt + bracers
and maybe cloak
https://i.nuuls.com/kmrSU.png
12.1k
going t5 chest instead of vestments is even more stam
ofc i do?
Everyone has that talent
literally everyone
so you dont take stamina talents in demo tree
what do you take then?
succubus dmg? imp dmg? voidwalker dmg?
how am i being dense
you can have warrior commanding shout, another lock switch to imp
if you are affli ur not tanking illidan anyway
and if ur affli you have imp
you cant dmg him during demon phase
because you cant phase him
have you killed illidan on ptr bro?
okay
how many times did you dps him under 30% in demon phase
okay why didnt you push him under 30% in demon phase?
why would you have affli tank him when destro is just better
more hp better threat
you cant dps him during demon phase
and wearing 3 Sr pieces isnt that big dps loss
much better to be safe and have destro tank it
bringing affli is dps loss
its probably around the same
assuming affli lock isnt in the ele grp
nuking it is kinda risky first clear
if going for speed clear
depends on comp tbh
could be tight with 6 healers and 3 tanks
but if you run optimal comp with 8 locks 3 mages 5 healers
ofc its not a problem
council is kinda hard with 5 healers
and its the hardest fight anyway
if splitting strat works then council is free
will die so quick
if ur in good guild you run pretty much 0 first week
but people need a brain and rocket boots
if i had stygian pieces would use them for sure
but disenchanted
well maybe 1 piece
sr jc neck is pretty good already
any idea how much gold will we get from t6 clear
is it 20g from boss?
per boss*
@DasPartyPooper where do you see it?
not showing up on drops tab atleast
oh yeah
damn they fixed incubus black book bug
:peepohigh:
im so glad they care about this class
ofc not
but rapist demon bugs are fixed ofc
:peepohigh:
https://i.nuuls.com/Idokw.png
pretty sure they just cant fix the bug
like its too hard to code the fix
@Valethar he doesnt reset threat if you push him under 30% in demon phase
so its pretty risky
you need +35k raid dps to do it
yea after 2nd week pretty much no one will see demon phase
yea tanks can probably get back to top
especially if locks shatter
why would spriest pay 2.5k for vestments
:peepohigh:
like boomie or ele you could understand
but its literal 0 dps for spriest
hes a meme class,  ofc they want to grief the hero class of tbc
:peepohigh:
you think fury will top meters in t6? :peepohigh:
this is why people call you fury copers
yeah raid which is 90% 6 mob packs
im sure fury will top and not warlocks
when warlocks are doing 3-3.5k st dps depending on how many chain lusts they get
we dont need any lusts
but locks are best chainlust class
thing is most people dont understand locks didnt get any upgrades from t5 gear
while furies got massive upgrades
if you did mag correctly it was literally made for demo locks
5 stack channelers
dont think locks were md/ruin on speedkills
if they were probably had to do 100 resets
yes many of top 50 kills run unoptimal comps
and usually the best comp is fastest
as you can see from t5 speedruns
a lot of scuffed comps and one good comp top 1
progress comp was pretty much perfect
maybe they would have cut the phys group completly if they had any competition
locks were g2g for speedruns with oblivion set and t4 gear
actually need to gear a bit in t6
are these guys high
i can go sim seed dps right now and 3% crit isnt 10 dps
🤡
and are they calculating in this running around during the pack
when they could be casting
crit totem is 110 dps
on seed aoe
?
literally just simmed it bro
on 6 mobs
has shaman discord even theorycrafted is green jc neck worth it in 4 lock+ shaman grp
thats the real tc shit they should be doing
oh no no
cucked into toc
illidan tank wont be a thing 3-4 weeks into t6
no one will see demon phase
100 parse role :Pepeclown:
yes parses is the most important thing
🤡
thats why speedruns always have 99 or 100 parses
:Pepeclown:
i guess i must be dogshit player because i never got 99 on vashj or KT or moro
:pepehands:
speedruns wouldnt bother with that bro
i have posted optimal hyjal speedrun comp already here
and it has zero phys dps
20s *
?
thats a raid dps boost
assuming melees are using consumables
do ele shamans know they could just heal in that spec
and lose basically nothing
what does that even mean
per unit?
do people in other class discords speak like that
you can always make resto heal in ele spec
:peepohigh:
and run holy weaver
that way we dont need any support classes
its 110 dps
when not aoe capped
im pretty sure magma totem doesnt do 110 dps
20 dps over their p2 iirc
haste helps casting coe/cor too
and spriest should be holy novaing with blade of eternal darkness anyway
zd is a zergling on a stick
its warlock item
i love that it must be specific breakpoint they found
from simming every possible time
146 isnt real
its assuming player has 0 ping
and presses buttons absolutely perfectly
like sim would
:peepohigh:
no it depends on ur ping
and on a fact that you press button at exactly right millisecond
why would you give haste ring to spriest
might aswell DE it
wdym
they are getting cool dildo mace
and t6 eventually
ZERGLING ON A STAFF
IS LOCK PRIO
i dont play starcraft
wdym
i just said its a lock prio
just disenchant them
its better option
like mages did right
with nexus key
and t5 prio
and all the other loot right
skull is lock class trinket
and ZD is lock bis?
wdym?
NK is decent on locks
but we didnt take it because that was the right thing to do
fang?
not really
have to compete with all the other locks and prot palas
Wdym?
dont you think you should gear tanks
not every paladin had bmagus blade
skull is warlock > holy weaver prio
for faster shadow vulne
you dont run dreamstate
when raid is 16 locks and healers
fury glaive stack will lose to locks
it will tho
you cant drag BT packs
so do healers?
paladin needs to stop in conc too
ele shaman has pretty much guarenteed raid spot tho
unless people start running ele healer
but spriest is easily replaceable by holy weaver
which will happen
spriests cant handle the truth
its sad
@3b you still want to run atleast 5 shamans
more is always better
first thing to do is cut healers/tanks
or make them play good specs like holy weaving
dildo mace?
idk should be prot pala prio imo
ids misery doesnt work
gotta be holy weaving
fire wont be viable in next phase
mages are arcane
and will stay arcane
arena weapon is 20 sp
who cares
shadow ward is 1.2k iirc
with normal gear
yes
but cant tank illidan with nether protection
so one lock needs to respec / not use it
did the ck 3 dlc finally come out
go catabolt
fire is dog anyway
no?
are u trolling
supremus has fire resistance
illidan demons fire immune
you want NP
it will and can help
aslong ur not tanking illidan
hyjal casters probably?
their logic doesnt rly work
we had s1 during black temple
in real tbc
so why was s2 gear added in t5 patch?
tbc som would be a great idea
so blizz is never doing it
yea actually hard tbc would be great
buffed kara
buffed mag + gruul
buffed t5
all great content
buffed heroics
so why didnt they release haste neck?
surely they will ban glaives from arenas
like they banned mqg
what risk
who cares about gems
go yellow sp/crit
no one cares about parses
its true tho
literally no one cares about parses
does anyone here care about parses?
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/gehennas/hannusumm#partition=2
good vashj / moro / KT parse was impossible unless you were in a parse guild
but who cares
no one
speedrunning automatically bricks your parses anyway
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/eu/gehennas/suwacko#partition=2
well this was our atiesh lock
so doesnt look like atiesh is that big deal
being on doom duty is way more important
and having good crit rng
should be warrior t6 in that pic
compared to other classes? 2m59s is perfect
nah 80s is too low
other classes have too high cd uptime
longer it goes but stays below 3 better it is
zergling on a stick is ugly?
:peepohigh:
ur not a warlock
yep
t5 and hyjal was in the game on release
gnome is best racial for seeding tbh
belf female maybe a bit better
leaks said wotlk by late fall
i think
Destro pot isnt always better than mana pot tho
yes that sounds 100% retarded
so blizz is most likely doing it
as long t4 as swp/t6
literal peak blizzard
LITERAL PEAK BLIZZARD
blizz is the fucking worst gaming company in the history
wotlk will be doa
and final nail  in the coffin
sure it does
its doa
tbc som is their last shot
but it would be a good idea so ofc they wont be doing that
spoken like a true wotlk babby
but you forgot MUH ULDUAR
blizz just sees how badly classic som is doing
because they fucked it omega hard
and wont be doing tbc som
which would be good
do anglos really?
is dlc out yet
:peepohigh:
i cant play ck3 until they add more achievements
:peepohigh:
2 pala tanks and feral?
yeah
double prot will be good in BT
2x cooldowns/sappers is big
well anglos just refers to english / americans
no?
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-eternal-anglo
waste gold on what?
mother is doable with 0 sr
if you wipe to rng go again
sunfire has tooltip
there is tho
requires tailoring (350)
all thr swp items are insane
thats why we are going +4k dps
we are getting chainlusted so PI does nothing
idk if engi will even be meta for swp speedruns
its probably going be more about how much dps you can pump
you can just buy sunfire too
going be omega expensive tho
you shoul do that
oblivion
but you wont be using oblivion in ZA patch
you get too many good haste items
its 3 day reset
yea
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/4m4eR1gdzPV7XQPBvpqa5m
ZA haste set
@gremmer🐢 actually need the hit from wand here
barely at 5% hit
spend 1-2k per raid and lose to warlocks
sounds fun
spell pen can be useful on council
depending on the strat you do
1.2s shadow bolt is lowest you can go in swp bis and all procs
1.1s incinerate
1.2s is best you can do
in absolute full swp bis
wand is straight up better for locks
solarian wand is like 1 dps upgrade over 25 shadow dmg wand
other discords cant handle the truth
and didnt you quit wow odaal
why are you in class discord
skull and zd drops from same id = fun
they dont drop = no fun
na wont know before us
resto shaman should use t2.5 if they want haste
has anyone calculated how much haste rating it is for them
bro
their t2.5 is like 1k haste
why arent they using it
:peepohigh:
https://i.nuuls.com/ZdE1t.png
how much is that?
600
700?
its not less than 300 lmao
174 unbuffed
you prio lock tank on hearts ofc
succubus ruin is literally grief spec
taking toc on lock is hard grief
give it to mages / prot palas
toc is a dead item half of the raid
if not more
hardly?
false
looks like you havent simmed ZD vs bowiz
then you would know ZD beats it in every fight above 10s
its doesnt really
ZD is just too fat
crit+haste+int
yeah non locks do
when its lock item
gear is extremely important in t6
skull,zd,haste rings,t6 all massive
you dont use it tho
unless fight is under 10s
zergling staff Pog
do prot palas even use that illidan helm
looks dogshit
its literally false
bowiz is worse for aoe
longer the fight better ZD is
and spriest get literal dogshit from ZD
whats the point ?
you dont gain 70 dps "relative"
thats literally false
its literally 10 dps upgrade over pvp mace
dont care just dont spread ur fake news here
you can do it freely in priest discord
it wont tho
unless you run 16 lock comp
it doesnt tho
or is 100 dps almost identicel here?
bro
its fucking lvl 73 mobs and under hitcap
just quit from this discord
ur clueless

that config you posted is dogshit
it had jow and seal of the crusader enabled, lvl 73 mobs
under hitcap on 73 mobs
you mean custom isb? it doesnt affect seed sim
you always have time to tap even when chainpulling
you do tho
and if you dont its free taps basically because of threat
ofc you can
heal aggro most likely
flask stacks
fire isnt viable next phase
its really not tho
stop lying to people
so you think not taking np, forcing mage to go arc/fire and not being able to be fire on 2 bosses in BT is viable
its not viable in warlock stack either
because in warlock stack you want nether protection
and fire cannot be used to illidan / supremus
its 0-10 dps better than shadow
boosting spriest dmg alone makes shadow way better
no you cant
you take nether protection because you cant be fire on 2 bosses anyway
and mage going arc/frost is better anyway
???
simming is inventing numbers?
not a single speedrun will be using fire locks
not a single one
dont care go fire if you want but dont tell people here to go fire
in casual guild you really dont want to have fire locks
because they probably arent even swapping sacs
and mage probably isnt scorching
even if hes arc/fire
casual guilds should have shadow locks
just watch them cast incinerates on supremus / illidan demons
they will figure it out eventually
@Void113 yes meta changes
these people dont seem to understand it
well its called warglaives not warriorglaives
more int also
iirc
and felguard is just free dps
felguard is the only viable demo spec
all
not a single real fight is 15-20s
bloodgem is the best hit piece if you really need it
is hildi gnome player
:peepohigh:
on female belfs?
yes
immolate is very good 2nd global
no?
you take nether protection
which is actually useful
and dump points into cata because what else would you take
you tank week 1-2
after that no one tanks
t5 legs is bis
t5 helm is bis if you arent engi
t5 chest is decent if you dont have vestments
gloves/shoulders are dog
@Healspls bro thats dogshit take
nether protection is always useful
warlocks cant tank elementals
:peepohigh:
tanks need fire res simple as that
firemaw lags too much
na wins
ur not even getting into raids bro
firemaw is bricked
like gehennas was p1 vanilla -> p2 tbc
did they have thaddius buff?
i thought it was just normal
you rotate lip+aoe taunts and dmg is uncapped
pretty sure you didnt need thaddius buff for that
mages had uncapped aoe
locks too
you just rotated lip+aoe taunt
that tier list is so bad
warlock is literally S S S
firemaw lags too much
progress lost already
sure they will buddy
yes mother is the only place in whole t6 where you take shadow/fire dmg
🤡
and its 30% chance to literally take 0 dmg from FA
quags+motc
decent dps boost
what is this for spriests
10 dps?
its not tho
atleast for spriests
well its not
how much dps does spriest do on multidot?
breakpoint math?
how much dps does spriest do on multidot
simple question
simple answer
3k ?
i have never seen spriest do 3k dps
Are u trolling
lock sim doesnt hit 10k pretty much ever
ok show me a fight where spriest is 3k
also 5 sp difference
it is tho
when i simmed it motc was always bteter
but could have been because of haste gems
gl everyone with skull & zd drops
hatefury mantle is omega big id say
for council if not doing split strat
false
p2 gear has too much hit
when you start to replace blasting items then you could use nethervoid
but thats not p2 gear
free?
its spriest omega bis
nethervoid is dead item on trash
its literally useless 60-70% of the raid
well you dont use icon/pipe on trash
its minimal upgrade for bosses
on trash its dead item
should rly go for haste/crit cloak
marks will just crash flask prices
nice one blizzard
:peepohigh:
ofc you go nether prot
raid has a lot of fire and shadow dmg
unless ur tanking
https://i.nuuls.com/AEj7a.png
we gaming
2 rings already
at ros
https://i.nuuls.com/hSNBE.png
too easy?
why is blizzard fixing AH lag now
they didnt do anything when gehennas AH was broken on release
no ZD :pepehands:
skull tho
i think we got it as drop
how is that bad
its good
if skull and ZD shared table
that would be very bad
blizzard has big problem tbh
they kinda need to rush out swp now
or playbase is gone
you can seed like first global
because its omega aoe capped
mages cant compete in bt tbh
too good raid for locks
https://i.nuuls.com/qNSGM.png
this was our hyjal
https://i.nuuls.com/WPPUD.png
oh lets include meme classes too
@Stabile how many of those locks were t6 bis?
or even close?
no?
you spec nether protection
stop giving shit advice
decent
t6 and ZD are bigger upgrades tho
movement doesnt make immolate better
lock has +26% inc healing
which is the best defense for bloodboil
omega good on aoe
i got haste ring too
no t6 and ZD tho
we got 2 caster rings
so idk
its rng
t6 wings are cooler
ZD is cooler
what server are you on
what kind of server first guild even sees demon phase
patterns are common as fuck
imagine not having skull
thats high IQ play by mage
lowering warlocks dmg
ZD on boomer is literally same as disenchanting it
boomkin is just fine for normal raids
it just doesnt work in speedruns
could juggling strat work with 2 locks specced NP
Anyone have any idea how Blessing of Spell warding targeting works on council
is it just random?
@megamoose i mean is it random when it targets caster mob
and when the priest
its worth it in BT
but not in hyjal
hopefully they push out ZA asap
so many good haste items
why would you need fury for MH
https://i.nuuls.com/I61Mx.png
hyjal comp
could replace some resto shamans with eles tbh
if going for MH speedrun you have like 0 time to drink
atleast in ally camp
its hyjal skycrab
mobs dont hit anything
bro mobs have 150k hp
misery is literally whatever
and you can just run holy weaver
why not
resto druid is great with prot palas
and one hot on lock is enough to fully heal him
ZA patch has shitload of haste items
dont need haste gems really
go orange
atleast in gloves/legs
helm too
blue+orange in boots/shoulders
in vestments you can go for set bonus or full reds
https://i.nuuls.com/D_6cm.png
this is bis gems
but vestments is fine with 2x oranges+purple too
@Elguapo useful on council depending on strat you do
can go threat enchant ofc too
https://i.nuuls.com/rZFre.png
:peepohigh:
really dont want hit from cloak
its dead item on trash
give to spriest first
skull is literally useless on prot pala
they do more than enough threat
its literally useless
prot palas do insane threat
palas should just use 2x defensive trinkets
literally dont need any more threat
doesnt change the fact that prot pala does too much threat already
they should just wear defensive shit
heal cloak isnt bis for palas
KT cloak is
quags
female belf is bis with t6
bro permanent +10 sp
unironically 2nd best racial after orc
catabolt isnt a meme in t6
immolate spec is meme
yes because you can take nether protection (if ur not tanking illidan)
:peepohigh:
how
nice pots week 1 :peepohigh:
@Skycrab https://i.nuuls.com/xZLwc.png
any zergling staff roles
way cooler item
theres just shitload of gems
so many gems actually drop
30 isnt many?
one character needs like 8-10 gems
skull role should be legendary orange
purples arent useless
every caster wants 2
tanks want blues
holy
why not just DE it
that trash farm doesnt work on classic i think
why would you use pvp gem
when you can use pyrestone
ehh not sure about that one
2x oranges+purple works just fine too
@shadowtyrant its 10 dps difference and this is with fixed ISB
so its very close
and you get 7 stam for free
you go channeled elements legs+ t6
yeah bro fire is totally viable
thornlings work for gargoyles?
make it orange jannies
:peepohigh:
https://i.nuuls.com/1Mr2p.png
why does blizz care so much about som
fix the seed bug
should we start using adept's elixir+draenic wisdom for mount hyjal waves
probably worth it
distilled wisdom isnt that good i think
yes switching sacs might be the play too
4%
3% actually
i think it was extra seed every 12s
adept's elixir+ distilled wisdom isnt that big upgrade with infinite mana
so felhound sac might be the play actually
DN is dogshit
you will play catabolt
and you will be happy
whats the best wave to use infernal on
gnome :yikes:
cataclysm is literal whatever
you go for nether protection
yeah
wheres my legendary orange color on skull role
:peepohigh:
catabolters take 3/3 nether protection
if they are griefers sure
ZD is lock item
so where do you get the hit
skull?
no its lock item
ehh id rather take toc+chronicle as mage
helps with filler too
who cares
dogshit shard drops always
mages gem hit now so they can steal ZD
so have people figured out optimal mother positioning yet?
searing pain / immolate / shadowburn
skull is pretty common tbh
idk bro
2/3 skulls in our raids already
2 daggers too
archimonde drops dogshit
healer chest+healer OH
never
no zergling staff for you :sadge:
t6 helm is unironically biggest upgrade this phase
wings too cool
sim it
actually nimble thought + angerspark sims 10 dps better
oblivion set probably
and he starts casting instantly when combat starts
do you use oblivion
doom?
whats the activity difference
https://i.nuuls.com/VYoTc.png i mean this was our day 1 clear
but i was on doom
both of those locks are pumpers
immolate spec was better p2
now catabolt is better
its simple as that
for parsing you want 60-70% crit on shadow bolt
and only cast shadow bolt
gargolys dont do anything
https://i.nuuls.com/YcLV5.png
insane seed belt for hyjal btw
:pepebrain:
@KilLogic int
ur gonna put 2x lionseye gem on seeding bob
which you replace when you get haste belt
either caster or healer one
and 30 int is pretty fat
especially with felhunter sac
never got it ofc
spellfire chad
https://i.nuuls.com/rDxS1.png
look at that fat INT
9.3k mana unbuffed
actually insane
id rather go with int route especially with felhunter sac
im poor atm
cant get crafted shoulders
had to buy epic flying for netherwing dailies :peepohigh:
literally 1-2 weeks
and demand 0
supply is massive
just buy all the yellows & oranges once they crash
(they will eventually)
and then moon in swp
go up in price
arent gems pretty expensive with badges
oh rip
thats free after 4-6 months of ZA
people gonna have too many badges
dont bowiz smuggle
just equip it for seed packs
no its smuggling
always has been
you are smuggling in bowiz switches
its smuggling
:peepohigh:
smuggling is better
because you are smuggling in switches
bowiz weaving is too forced
its smuggling
its the original term
problem on bloodboil is tank dodging all the threat drops
makes it very hard to tank switch
yeah or mt has to chill
t6 is bis for affliction
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/oAQ2NpN7vNWiMSksYzJv13
37% haste in swp bis
yea play was to do whatever until 68
then do lvl 70 dungeons
was so nice to have oblivion before i was lvl 70
it was so cancer
wotlk dungeon spam will be done in like a day
wotlk lvling will be a joke
its the easiest expansion
in every way
@Chicoscabana skull
everything else is replaced
well and  t6 shoulders/helm for set bonus
wait is that real
they really banning gdkps?
@GAMING WARLORD you can use it in raids?
so you can use it in raids?
2 /3 versions
soul leech isnt bad
it atleast does something
soul leech does something, other talents dont do anything
its simple choice
SOUL LEECH DOES SOMETHING
OTHER TALENTS DONT DO ANYTHING
what is so hard to understand
burn phases ?
like what
we are raiding t6
if you are tanking illidan something went wrong anyway
And if you are tanking illidan you arent taking NP anyway
nether protection is best utility talent in t6
(if you arent tanking)
it doesnt afaik
you take nether protection and soul leech
what else would you take?
you dont cast immolate / sp /incinerate
just bind use water with life tap
whats hard
should work
mage food doesnt work
only water works
you use eye always
skull > motc > eye > pipe > icon
mark of the champion
its not tho
and you cant use trinket with skull
you cant*
barely any fights will last 2 mins even soon
maybe council and illidan
sure they have week 1
but dps gains will be insane
atleast for locks
idk about other classes
fire isnt that good t6
they should go shadow
fire was better p1 & p2 tho
ofc you use skull when lusted
why not
catabolt is the high IQ spec
fire talents on mother are a meme
switching to fire spells isnt worth it
go nether protection catabolt with 2/3 soul leech
:peepohigh:
@Ryusei switching schools would have been the play if we had prenerf prismatic shield
but we got post nerf mother
if we had prenerf mother, most guilds would be hard stuck on it right now
@Xelrog all true btw
skull color is scuffed
we need legendary orange
:peepohigh:
@Sotomatic thats how vanilla bosses worked
t6 bosses are just random
pretty much every boss had loot tables
gressil and THC was in the same table
blizzards greatest fuck you
i have always seen only 3 items
2x tier + 1 normal loot
pretty much it has nothing to do with rogue
mother drops 1 item too right?
its one 6 item loot table
on mother & council
madness is like omega bis
probably better than DST
has anyone seen 2x weapons / 2x non weapons drop from illi / archimonde?
2x 5% drops and literally everyone who zoned into BT cleared
its not tho
you dont hear about people who didnt get glaives
you dont tho
so did you ask every single guild on ur server who cleared t6
did they get glaives
fucking shard always drops
:peepohigh:
bulwark is omega big
for prot pala
prot pala really doesnt need sp shield tbh
threat is already insane
toc to prot paladiN?
what the fuck
if that proc doesnt have icd should be up pretty often
ZA will be great  content tho
insane loot
nice 3 days reset
bears
swp is just different
first boss has 10.5m hp
2nd*
muru will actually filter guilds
which cant stack locks week 1
wotlk will be omega easy compared to tbc
even hardmodes
sure raiding got hard when they added mythic difficulty
yea thats why blizz didnt want to add prenerf mother
would have been too hard
prenerf mother would have been hard
original prismatic shield and instant 3k tick
it would have been hard
you have prot paladin mt illidan
not prot warrior
go clear t5 once?
takes 2h and prot pala has all the mit gear
CTR was great
too bad they didnt make CTR remake pc game
would be so good
just quit when wotlk comes
its dogshit expansion
how does he play with that few keybinds
i have like 6 bars and having massive problems fitting everything
biggest upgrade whole tbc
you paid 500g for crusade deck?
other people cant see wings?
but other people can see them?
thats fine
not pressing cor griefs you too
way slower kill times
tell warriors to press demo shout and cor doesnt increase dmg like at all
150-210 is way too long for t6
120-160 is the fight length
in few weeks could maybe even go 100-140
for most fights
what
locks have way too much hit
but should take haste belt ofc
for illidan tanking i went with cloak+belt+bracers+neck(could also use resistance flask)
very barely
its 1-2 dps difference
wearing only rocket boots gives you 1k
wait 2-3 weeks
and heard of darkness is 50g
dropping engi, levelling tailoring to 375 dropping it and relevelling engi is pretty expensive
and every lock needs to do it
just stack crit for hyjal
in next phase you go full haste meme with ZA gear
its not tho
just dont afk in raids
pump
just get the dagger
isnt it 5% drop
holy nova spriest is the most based shit ever
FUCK MAGES
you only run affli in caster stacks
how much dps does max sp consecration do
:monkaS:
will rets beat us
ele aoe is fucking grief
my ele did it
those enhas with ravagers will beat us too
:monkaS:
its over lock bros
what the fuck
those locks are dogs tho
easy to hit +3k
mc isnt worth it bro
we need to discuss the big question fellow warlocks
t6 helm or shoulders in swp
wings or no wings
sapph enchant problem??
:peepohigh:
i have full bis setup already figured out
but its no wings setup
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/pNv9HyJUe3UFRypuy828DU
bro i made this set like 4 months ago
you copied my set
well you said i copied ur set
when i made it first like 4 months ago
https://i.nuuls.com/4WX0e.png
this is when i made it
my set has greens ?
muru is a fight
so you gem haste
do green gems count as both yellow & blue
if going for MSD
requirement
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/gdMQjnCegJBsrDa5D4sNFu
omega bis p4 seed set is here
angerspark is 0 int
not good for seeding
its same crit
even less if you count in int from studious wraps
you dont want 2x reds on MSD seed set
lock t6 is only like 500 dps
not that big
demo is fucking dogshit
@Blow make the shadow nova meta
we need to cuck mages
5% on 150k hp mobs?
who cares
they do if you push into spawn point
council is good fight for locks if you do correct strat
most guilds just do scuffed strat atm
dps caster mob
not paladin
mage doesnt have reflect
check progress replay
council
and youll see the correct strat
MSD works on hildi sim right?
how is no cooldowns boring?
locks have 100% uptime on cooldowns
god i wish female humans were real
https://i.redd.it/5cxvf3zdq9f81.jpg
on reddit
what the fuck
:peepohigh:
@Ryusei i tested it twice and didnt get a proc
but my guildies said they got it
other guildie said its only live on NA
idk
anyone in fight club?
i want to see their reaction to chicken bug fix
melee stack was dead already
why would they stealth reverse it
they still havent fixed seed bug
pala is pink
warlock is purple
or you simply dont care
no one cared about chickens in vanilla
will be same now
*coughs blood*
this is why blizz wont fix seed btw
they literally can not
they dont have coders who can fix it
time to fix seed bug now blizzard
:peepohigh:
if you are fixing bugs
@Shii on NA?
its only fixed on NA
how?
just have people preheal
and pala doesnt die
even with enrage
yea did you see progress run fire locks jpaint
surely will be meta
its ancient meme
but perfect timing
pretty much wrong
only mobs with +200k should be cursed
unless caster stack
then pretty much everything should be coe
each pack has like 1-2 mobs which should be cursed
its whatever
literally doesnt matter in BT guys
prenerf t5 was different
cast coe on 1-2 highest hp mobs
or dont
doesnt matter
this will be never done tbh
atleast in speedruns
pservers?
pretty sure thats pserver
haste shoulders are massive for seeding
isnt crit dog with 4pc t5
crit is good with t6
because they stop casting moonfire
?
they dont stop casting moonfire with t6?
and class trinket ?
@Louki seems like you know a lot about druids
they dont stop casting moonfire?
boomie is just fine for normal raids
just dog for speedruns
world first raid isnt a speedrun
in speedruns wiping is fine go next week
damage output limits strats, pull speed
vashj trash pull
easily wipe if dog aoe
more dps you have safer everything is
warlocks already pass on the contested pieces like crit cloak, noose , boots
:peepohigh:
what do other classes want more
imagine playing wotlk
NGMI
blizzard could be serving steaming shit on a plate and you people would eat it
you can just dps mage mob
no need for spell pen
does nether protection work on silence
its not
best is catabolt
felhunter sac is strong
does NP work on azgalor silence
3 skulls from 4 raids fellow warlocks
all to locks ofc :pepebrain:
well be faster
its only faior
you shouldnt be punished for going fast
speedrunners are already hard cucked from boss parses
why should they be cucked out of total dps parses
4 months for t4
4 months for t6
not even blizzard is that retarded
???
compare t4 and t6
t4 is 2 onyxias + ubrs
and its as long as t6 ?
most people cleared t4 week 1
they should have done original timelines
but they FUCKED IT UP
LIKE THEY FUCK UP EVERYTHING
hopefully they make tbc som
buffed everything would be great
mechanics and 40 man just doesnt work
40 man is just massive problem
wotlk will be solo healed by disc priests
whole expansion
its a meme
1 disc is omega healer
holy palas are support healers
blow you passed ZD?
👍
its way better for locks
whats holy nova aoe cap btw
no way
well its still more than normal spriest rotation on hyjal trash
if ur going fast dont have mages
easy fix
well if going fast you just run holy weaver anyway
ret pala #3 dps on aoe
they do like 3k
make skull role legendary orange
same as on hildi sim
every ret has that set tho
why wouldnt they
https://i.nuuls.com/yQwml.png
add this color to skull role
:peepohigh:
guys upvote this post im about to do
add this color to skull of guldan role https://i.nuuls.com/yQwml.png
upvote it
!suggestion
wait how does this shit work
go upvote on suggest channel guys
does NP work on azlagor?
@Healspls it works?
SR isnt good tactic
you just need priest buff and resist it
or if NP works pray it procs
@spoar its a shadow spell
so sit in rof?
it doesnt even deal that much dmg afaik
rof is average hit 1.7k
NP makes it like 0 dmg
whats the hellfire uptime on azgalor?
toc is omega grief
ZD isnt even mages bis on ZA patch
its too good
actual omega grief
mages want to use HxH
they actually need hit from somewhere
mages use 4pc t5
rain of fire procs nether protection right?
does rain of fire proc nether protection?
thats an easy fix
sit in rof with np
??
it deals 1.8k per tick bro
and you have nether protection
pretty sure rof isnt a dot
@spoar coming
@spoar realm 1?
@spoar lets do it on pvp server
or not
realm 1
i dont have binds on pvp server
@spoar whats ur name
yea
im here bro
realm 1?
was on realm 2
yea
coming
bro test searing pain
yeah looks like rof doesnt work
hellfire doesnt proc either
:peepohigh:
blizz hates locks
cba it doesnt work
:peepohigh:
healers already have KT cloak
most casters are still using t4 loot
t4 cloak *
why does healer need haste?
to oom faster?
nothing needs extra hps atm
council is mana fight
you can bop felrage
bop them anyway?
and it hits melee very rarely
because cant target furies
you need around 35k raid dps
to do it without demon phase transition
its not that hard
easily doable even with 6 healers
bael is holy weaver
the chad priest spec
depends on comp
if you run optimal comp you pretty much never tap
but if you run normal comp which 99% of people do then you will tap
or just sac felhunter
do you have any haste items?
you go oom very fast with bowiz+skull+quags
pot and dark rune arent up for every pull
sappers have 1 / 5 min CD
very worth it in hyjal
sp is literally dead stat
only ZD is better weapon
900g is very worth it for bowiz
unless ur #1 on ZD
bro ZD is massive for spriests
its literal 10 dps
its like 5% of their dps
well you obviously want to grief the raid then
because taking toc as lock is hard griefing
thats like taking ZD on non warlock grief
looks like that guild doesnt want warlocks in their raids
its easy gquit
let boomie do coe and cor
you always go 30 int on bowiz
whole point of that item is getting more seeds off
always
if ur casting shadow bolt with oblivion equipped ur hard fucked anyway
archimonde loot table is bugged right?
only drops dogshit
oh no no
council is the hardest boss in speedruns
especially if going with 4-5 healers
just ask for innervates
mages dont need them
just bind light to F3
press F3 when you are flying down
boss is dead
you can screencap that and give it to anyone who has problems on archimonde
why would you ever run affli in 2 lock raid
:peepohigh:
cowl has no wings
and is worse than channeled elements / vestments
thats why
@degenerate wrong
you go oranges in helm/legs/gloves
get 2 blues in vestments , shoulders or boots
3x reds in vestments is viable if you have t6 boots already
why not
2 hit
its not ded
https://i.nuuls.com/ibjpu.png
163 hit
@Chainsmoker no belt equipped
you dont tho
you replace motc with hxh
and thats it basically
get haste cloak if guild cucked you out of true bis haste cloak
:peepohigh:
my bis setup is BIS
163 hit
you cant get better than that
??
bro crit is good stat
in swp ofc you use haste gems
because haste is even better stat
hit green?
never even heard of it
must be dog
you mean the heroic green gem?
thats actual dogshit which you dont want to use with t6 gear
yea you dont want to gem hit
when you can get it for FREE
using oranges
nothing wrong with oranges bro
literally nothing
council cloak also simply doesnt drop
so gl getting it
we will be running HKM cloak into ZA
illidan only drops skull and shard
:peepohigh:
nice one blizzard
https://i.nuuls.com/wgudo.png
archimonde drops so far
and they say loot is random
:peepohigh:
4/5 kills exact same OH + plate chest
:peepohigh:
actually hate blizzard
its a screenshot
https://i.nuuls.com/5I2RJ.png
does this work
nether protection works on council flamestrike btw
omega big
skull is good in swp
but its not omegabis t6
ZD and t6 both are way bigger upgrades
:peepohigh:
mages crying for toc+chronicle next phase when they finally understand its better
:peepohigh:
literally can not make this shit up
hex shrunken skull
they run into massive hit problems
skull isnt even bis for them right now
how many haste pieces do you have @Fira
:peepohigh:
its 2.41 with 2 items?
haste is omega big then i guess
i have seen 3 on my lock
how big is it for mages
yea probably like 10 dps
crit is so good stat for them
wrong cringe
its very good for st too
very good
and mainly scales from crit
it is tho
yea
and ashtongue is like the best
because mages want to use hex shrunken skull
and lose hit from trinket
its better for locks on aoe and ST tho
wrong
you havent simmed
unlucky
do you know what stats ZD has?
do you know the duration on bowiz proc
difference is already super small bro
toc vs ZD
we are talking 1-5 dps difference
with skull
?
well thats just not happening
even on this gnome sim
toc+chronicle is literally the same
and alliance needs 12 hit less
no they cant
dont trust mage lies
they will always sim specific fight lengths until they get what they want
just dont believe them
easy
uhhh
show t6 legs with toc+chronicle
and lets add duration +/- 10
so mage sim cheating doesnt work
post ur toc setup
cba to do it myself
bro
these links are correct?
https://i.nuuls.com/yu9rv.png
ZD
https://i.nuuls.com/B73-2.png
TOC
these gears and all the settings are right?
not on this sim
are u trolling?
oh so double innervate now?
even with 50k iterations toc chronicle setup is better
oh so mages blame sim now when results are "wrong"
like not showing ZD as bis?
why is this ui so dogshit compared to hildi sim
mage sim is just scuffed
why do you need to manually setup cds
:peepohigh:
176 unbuffed is enough
if still using warlock tank at all
dmg done as ghost on teron doesnt count in total dmg?
so if you get ghost ur hardcucked?
@Bael no i didnt see because they banned me
gl keeping felguard alive on council
is the magic immunity blessing target random on council ?
on our last kill caster mob got it 3x early and then for 2 minutes didnt get it at all
https://i.nuuls.com/x2cQ-.png
magic immunity buffs on caster
is it just random or somekind of range thing?
so does anyone have any idea how blessing of magic warding targets are decided on council ?
is it random?
so you need to do magic dmg on rogue / priest ?
if you dont want buff on caster ?
no
you give ele to locks
unless mage starts casting coe/cor themself
can we stop this ele discussion
go back to important stuff
how to avoid blessing of magic warding on caster mob
(zerevor)
idk if its random
https://i.nuuls.com/ZThgN.png
this was our last kill
can that really be random
cant be that
we all focus zerevor mainly
during that 2 mins
with no spell warding
idk
0 spell wardings on malande seems weird
something went wrong
pretty much no one
mage during spell warding
so have one caster do dots or something on malande?
and on rogue ?
maybe its line of sight thing?
imagine having lust on supremus
imagine
how slow do u guys go
you need to split if you want to speedrun in next 2-3 months
gearing 4 locks to be speedrun rdy takes 2-3 months
and if going for optimal comps ur running 8-13 locks in BT
yes that statement was true p1-2
not anymore
gta DEMASTERED
have fun buying rockstars dogshit
mana pot in most fights t6
barely any free taps
you oom very fast during lust
just mana pot its cheaper
yeah great qol bros
losing 4 minute bloodlust
GREAT QOL CHANGE FOR FURIES
you just focus zerevos
all casters
if he gets magic shield switch to gathios
progress used it
thats all you need to know
its rng ?
or maybe its not rng
idk how magic immunity targets are decided
yes ally dodges wpvp
on every server
second they go under 50.0000000%
alliance is dead
and looking to switch to another server
if you dont need hit from bob infinity is way better
its not overlooked?
my bis setup runs it because its bis for aoe & and like 1-2 dps worse than noose on ST
and doesnt need epic gems
bis = bis
if you dont care about total raid dps
ur dog
still havent fixed seed bug
maybe we should email bill gates
dali doesnt understand lock is the only scaling class in tbc
:Pepeclown:
many such cases
SAD!
problem is mages dont scale
and especially dont scale with haste
spriest ZD is too much
but if its omega casual guild idk
you tell him
if you take ZD and dont outdps me
im quitting
let that spriest press coe/cor
its one extra tick on sim
not on ingame btw
warrior/enh doesnt scale well
warlock scales well
warriors just lost 25% haste
they arent hitting same dps numbers ever
:peepohigh:
you always show helm bro
especially with t6
imagine using noggenfogger
cant see when you have oblivion equipped and when not
well if i was tailoring
i would for sure go haste shoulders + 4pc oblivion
but if you arent tailoring / wont switch and craft shoulders it doesnt matter
well id just keep going for gloves
its worth i think
airburst interruption isnt that bad
compared to moving the boss and maybe getting knockback
makes decursing very easy too i think
with normal strat you have to move boss a lot
and you can get knocked
so i think its better for raid dps
im so triggered bros...
europe is on same continent as asia?
how will i EVER recover from this
escaped to 2h queues
enjoy
lmao
gnome looks so scuffed
wait
why does that strat blacklist logs?
???
???
no its perfectly viable tactic
makes the boss faster
wtf
so the best archimonde tactic blacklists logs?
really?
:peepohigh:
they didnt ban sapphiron EXPLOIT
why are they banning this
? why do you need one button macro for it
come to gehennas
assuming ur horde
pve server? oh no nono
do americans really?
really?
fanta in cooking
:peepohigh:
pantaloons for seed gear
ZA might drop badges
so idk
@Volt only better in hyjal
hyjal packs are aoe capped
and mobs die at same time
so oblivion is pretty much 0 value
@Geefers haste rings are biggest upgrade for locks
and mages dont even want 2x
@Jujutsu cant be big difference
zizz didnt make it
are you orc?
on non orc doesnt matter rly
when you press skull
using destro pot on most bosses is dps loss
even in swp bis you dont hit gcd cap
you hit 1.2 shadow bolts and 1.1s incinerates
you dont use procs in swp bis 🙂
you can but not realistically
with real gear
1.2 shadow bolts in swp bis during lust + skull + drums
imagine not having np
imagine casting immolate like a cuck
https://i.nuuls.com/HHgUK.png
why cant trolls be locks :pepehands:
so doom illidan when hes at 65% ?
:peepohigh:
it doesnt work at all?
BT needs triple it
double it isnt enough
anyone got mark of illidari auto need wa?
well you dont always seed
and 34 sp still has value on seed
in BT
neck itself has a lot of crit too
so its not that bad to have it on when seeding
you want KT neck for seeding anyway
not spellthread
no no
arc/fire is shit
mages play arc/frost and take 0 loot
they wanted it
and now they get it
yep
fuck mages
no one cares
mages are there for council tanking
literally no one gives a fuck what they play
imagine not using skull+eye
ehh
in horde camp cba
melees only lost 25% haste
its not that big deal
they will be able to compete with locks for sure
fury isnt that good on bosses tho
their ST isnt good at all especially with chicken nerf
short fights and fights over 3 mins favor them
how many lock has 4p t6?
glaives are massive?
give me numbers
lets see how massive
reck?
how about no reck
yes
i always hear how massive glaives are
never hear any numbers
cba
so we dont know how massive glaives are
well lock 4p set bonus alone is around 200 dps
and every piece is upgrade too
ZD is 80 dps
skull is 40-50 dps
i have seen one reddit post where fury sims at 3k
in swp bis
with glaives
20 dps
around 100 dps on aoe
feel free to go sim
https://i.nuuls.com/BeTm7.png
id go with this
have prot pala heal on council
there was demo lock on bench
:peepohigh:
@Stabile that comp has 5 healers?
0 pieces of t6
:peepohigh:
2nd ret is 0 utility
and low dps
you never bring 2 rets
he was talking about arms?
and fury should be even higher?
what do you mean
yeah 2 rets is grief
fury brings so much more utility
its not even funny
you dont cut ele
ever
its the last support class that is cut
just run 2 enhas
you dont run 2 rets
EVER
its literal  0 utility
dog dps
destroys groups
no?
but you dont run 2 rets
even 2 spriests is way better
because atleast 2nd spriest gives mana to other group
2nd ret does literally nothing
well its not
so its 200 dps?
okay thanks
thats "massive" i guess
very "massive"
this 2.5k sim result really is something
they really will be doing 3k in swp bis
yes the cleave
THE cleave
one fight is cleave in bt
2nd lock ofc
fury just isnt fun
no rage gain
too expensive consumables
loses to warlocks
its decent
and once someone figures out how blessing of magic immunity targeting works its afk casting on caster
oh you get items but nothing is real upgrade for u guys
your only scaling was 2p t5
glaives is OMEGA MASSIVE (200 dps) but warlocks 4pc t6 is nothing (300 dps)
its almost funny
ofc ?
t6 isnt just set bonus
its upgrade in every slot
:peepohigh:
bro
eye of the moam
ur a bit behind on this
its not worth it
just cast on mage mob
pray he doesnt get many immunes
??
you tell every caster to dps on mage mob
unless he has immunity
whats so hard
every 30s?
thats just wrong
https://i.nuuls.com/xyO5E.png
its pretty random id say
moam is 30s duration
:peepohigh:
spell pen might worth it if you have every other 4pc t6
and have hatefury
you can sim this btw
:peepohigh:
go sim it
its 250
you cant remove base resistance bosses have
:peepohigh:
i theorycrafted this about a month ago
you want hatefury shoulders and every other 4pc t6
put blue gems in hatefury
is it better than just dpsing caster mob and hoping he doesnt get many magic immunities?
probably not
gathios is moved too
what you should be doing is try to figure out how blessing of magic warding works
is it random or not
i have been trying
but you should be doing that too
Looks like its cast every 30s
but does target need to be in line of sight?
well coe and misery should be up on caster already
you really only lose rets 3% crit when dpsing on caster
its not a big deal
just hope for good rng
he means MSD
MSD is better if you can gem for it
but its pretty hard
will be viable next phase tho
tell your raid to not dps ghosts
and kill them alone
should be easy 99/100
@GAMING WARLORD works exactly like quags?
mage trinket will be omega bis for mages anyway
it only affects aoe where you have 100% uptime anyway
brutallus is 10.5m hp and 6 min enrage timer
will be hard for casual guilds after BT / hyjal / ZA difficulty
29k raid dps
well its a long fight
mages will hard oom
well yeah you bring 0 mages in swp if ur minmaxing
but casual guilds will bring them
most guilds will bring them
you can buy food & water from inns, int scrolls cost like 5s on most servers
???
ashtongue is working as intended
why are mages coping so hard
its literally been working like that on quags for whole expansion
locks still use it
doesnt work after instants
no they shouldnt
skull is lock only item
its unlucky
seed is bugged
mage trinket is bugged
unlucky
mage trinket is still insane for aoe
and skull is very small for them on ST
does seeding refresh duration?
welll then it just doesnt work
holy pala just has infinite mana
drink mana pots
but theres literally 0 fights where haste does anything on healers
its literal dead stat
now mages want to get bugs fixed?
why didnt they want to get seed fixed
skull + zd is bigger upgrade for locks tho 🙂
its unlucky that mages dont scale
its really unfortunate
ashtongue still is omega big for aoe
icon+morogrim trinket is just fine for ST
and next phase mages get hxh
161 is a problem
163 is fine
imo
165 is better than 161
mages dont take skull even if ashtongue is scuffed
because skull is dead trinket on aoe
why is using max retarded?
lock is very hard to go for max total dps
even 99th percentile is scuffed compared to well played lock
im not going to doxx myself here my dude
but i wouldnt worry about it
wouldnt worry about it bael
soon mages will be gone
after their welfare council job is removed
there wont be any mages
no there wont be in swp
int scroll is 5s in ah, food and water can be bought from inn keepers
thats literally all their utility
people just under estimate how much dps locks really gain from t6 gear
other classes wont even be close
no one is going to run warrior stack comp in t6
they just stack warlocks and pull 2-3 packs
well in swp its not even funny how good locks will be compared to other classes
how do you even get doom tick off on netherspite
must be like 2-3 min fight
@vanthel skull > motc > eye > icon
locks are very simple class
meant to tag @Vanthere
ZA is already theorycrafted
i made the best seed setup already
top ten locks probably had 0 partials
and thats why they are top 10
@Mentis aslong they click salv off and are given like 10-15s
its fine
locks can always shatter
and good crit rng
and ofc full t6 bis
does nothing
just equip rocket boots
i think its 33% chance to get magic immunity on caster mob
every ~30s
if its full random
zergling staff
actually good loot
t6 > t3 > rest of the shit tiers
fury is literal 0 iq class
you press ww+bt+cleave+hs
and stand behind mobs
very hard
female humans arent real
lock is the only S tier discord
babyhoof isnt getting glaives?
imagine playing fury and not using consumables
:peepohigh:
warlock costs 100g / week and is top dps
you actually profit from raiding
what engi stuff?
warlock cant just run into melee range
dark runes are very small
bbhf is a she now?
lost ark is already doa
its new world but even worse
its another amazon scam
if ur playing lost ark ur 100% cuck anyway
??
warlocks are strongest in t6
most of original tbc was during t6
in a month its going to be only purple
everywhere
https://i.nuuls.com/IqC_t.png
whats wrong with this class
i really wonder what will they do in a month
do they play with dogshit warlocks or what
im beating mage on pretty much every fight
bro kungens guild was shooting 8k shadow bolts in KJ kill
they just played different game
why didnt they recommend warlocks?
why?
why did they think 8 healers was needed
?
why did they think they need 4 tanks
sald bakers literally has 0 good locks left
they cant do anything as a guild anymore
nota didnt compete with progress
they werent even top 10
honestly? no one really
pretty much only progress ran good comps
https://i.nuuls.com/wN-ca.png
4 min difference in top 5
shouldnt happen
progress only group to run 4 healers
https://i.nuuls.com/b03p5.png
this is pretty decent spread
but vanilla speedrunning was way harder to pull off
literally anyone can go gear 8 locks in tbc
???
you go catabolt with nether protection
why wouldnt you
show me a single time imp scorch / emberstorm has had any value for you
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/4yWVG9fmqN7Y2ab3#boss=-3&difficulty=0&type=damage-taken&source=33
there you go fella
yes it does?
25% of vile beam dmg was removed
makes you basically immune to flamestrike
what else would you take?
you go catabolt with np
because what else would you take
literal 0 value
will shattarath flasks work in ZA or kara?
yes but it doesnt make sense they only work in 25 mans
real good in tbc
"good"
id go with almost decent
2 blue axes
thats what i used until AQ
cloak is whatever
warlocks will be #1 in a month
and not a single class will be even close in swp
what?
why isnt spoar muted
just trolls here
has anyone tested if shattrath flasks actually wortk
my hits feel low
has anyone tested them?
somethings wrong here
guess i have to
dots easiest way to test if shattrath flask works?
im in TK right now
my hits are low
idk why
it works atleast on tap
guess its just the lack of pipe
less big crits
Tap when out of mana
pretty easy
tap when moving
my favorite streamer is playing lost ark?? (#AD)
WOW
what fight length are you simming?
very small haste difference might not get you any extra casts
with very low time values
🤡
so how do you queue consumable and shadow bolt at same time?
teach us this skill
sylvanas pic?
i need to see this
no?
blizzard just cant code the fix
its staying just like seed bug is
they literally dont have any programmers left who could fix bugs
!jpaint
its not cheesing
Its literally the best way to kill the boss
well you wouldnt want it anyway
but mages want it even less
oblivion + nimble thought
capped one is whatever
stack crit & haste
but yeah illidari cowl is bis in ZA seed set
but t6 helm is pretty close too
oh no no no no no discord janny bros
lost ark is already dead lmao
once streamer contracts ends
its over
and this is why bezos is omega rich
right now?
escape from tarkov , ck3 mainly
played poe for 2 days on league start
but its boring
it is boring tho
it gets even boring on HC
when is lost ark going f2p?
might test it then
https://i.nuuls.com/ndtz6.png
ehh pretty much done with that game
and its going to be on steam?
bt+hyjal ?
difference shouldnt be that big
yea im not american :peepohigh:
imagine being american
you can beat mages in BT
easily
but not in hyjal
game ends once wotlk prepatch hits
if ur playing wotlk its unironically over for you
imagine having a single piece of t6
:peepohigh:
he will always be gnome
people played like that in original tbc btw
with 1024 resolution
and 100 kb / s internets
you will be back in naxx soon
only 6 months of naxx 10
how big dps loss is rogue using poison
for cast time increase
locks used physical meta crit gem back then
its true
thats why they added CSD to game
be lucky
ZD makes boomie do 1010 dps instead of 980
:peepohigh:
if that'
why would you use double use ever on illidan
quags is just straight up better because of downtime
oblivion is very useful in BT
is 1-375 tailoring expensive?
i have 3.4k rn
dont think its enough for 375 tailoring and then 330 engi
som magtheridon will be fun
som kara
som vashj
so much good content
affli?
still using pipe? :peepohigh:
its absolute dog on mages
skull is lock only item
mage doesnt even use skull in ZA
hxh + ashtongue or SCB
yes they do
i will atleast
hxh + scb or ashtongue
its not
why would i sim
mage sim is a meme
i have tailoring + alchemist mage alt
i think heals is undercover mage
if you can use hit from skill its like 80 dps
and you can always use the hit aslong you dont have toc
uhhh
ur simming with toc+chronicle right?
oh so ur simming with ZD 🙂
this is why you cant trust mages or their sims
so ZD setup with skull sims 20 dps better?
Are you sure ur not undercover mage?
starting to sound like one
ehh seems fine
theres haste neck & better wand in ZA patch tho
idk if those are better
yea custom CDs is the main reason why i cba to sim mage shit
??
hellfire was good on morogrim if you snapshotted it
quags+bowiz+drums+lust snapshotted hellfire does insane dps
warlock dmg is shit?
really
gem good shit
im personally going 2x pyrestones + blue in vestments
mage kite isnt even a good strat tho
you lose 1.5k dps
why would anyone do it
or you use priest to do threat? idk
she still casts them im pretty sure
just not as often
yeah 1 min afk because of airburst sounds smart
if you can click off petri
would be insane
pretty sure you could petri debuff on gurtogg
you can ice block it atleast
someone go test petri :peepohigh:
imagine paying for p2w game @spoar
its dead in 5 days once people get to p2w part
why bother
you go do dungeons
pull whole dungeon aoe them down
repeat
lvl 80 in few hours
yea wont play wotlk
it is?
wdym
t6 - swp will be warlocks peak
in whole game
in swp? yes
right now you cant cut mage
do you bring 3x arcane mages + spriest
or 4x locks + holy weaver
thats the question speedrunners will be looking at
3.3.5 wotlk is just dogshit
if you think t6 was too easy
just wait for wotlk
disc priest will be solo healing everything
not even speedrunners will play that dogshit expansion
its actually doa
is there a target dummy
we need to test warlock dps in full bis
whos the spriest slave
its a dps loss ofc
mage isnt doing any dps
casters cant dps mage mob
https://i.nuuls.com/to18t.png
where are the target dummies
:peepohigh:
need spriest over here
https://i.nuuls.com/kw2Jn.png
oh no no no no
this druid thinks hes getting ZD
OH NO NO NO NO
:peepohigh:
7.5k shadow bolts with no shadow priest
realm 1
bro ur not ally right :peepohigh:
ally is fine
ur just applying debuff
any shamans
i need lusts too :peepohigh:
wheres my spriest
why are my shadow bolts only hitting 8.7k :peepohigh:
does other factions debuffs actually work
wdym no ret?
no i have it on
https://i.nuuls.com/TLaW_.png
decent id say
was oom after like 40s
oh now i know
dont have 120 sp totem
thats why my hits were low
yeah 3k will be very realistic
in full bis
and optimal debuffs & buffs
someone tell this ZD boomie to hit lvl 73 dummy
that 2k dps was also 3% hit below hit cap
:peepohigh:
missing motc
use totems again
you had pipe in ssc/tk
all spriests left
:peepohigh:
https://i.nuuls.com/wsthv.png
would have been 10k with motc i think
0 pieces :peepohigh:
female belf?
why is shade of akama removed from partition?
wtf?
its not?
its a real boss
its always the same for everyone
all t6 bosses are joke
still they count
pushing out ZA would be so nice
we get around 25% haste in seed setup
2x hit gem bob fixes all hit issues
dont even need toc
bro bob with 2x hit gems
is easiest way to fix lack of ele
gdkp?
23k for 1 dps upgrade?
interesting
23k for 1 dps upgrade?
certainly is something
yep 1 dps this phase
not even bis next phase
t6 needed triple it
like pservers did
18m hp on illidan
12m on archimonde
those would be almost fights
18m on council
boomers will struggle on brutallus
its still around 30k raid dps check
10.5m in 6 mins
bowiz smuggling isnt real
dont bowiz smuggle
you waste your opportunities tapping
only gurtogg and council has free taps really in t6
100 on anarethon requires 0 silences probably
nothing to do with destro pots
its the sleep boss?
well then its just drinking slammers
its not tho
bowiz smuggling is hard grief
well "quite often"
you can go 2 mins with no spell warding
or roll it every 30s
@Severe is it?
i dont think its full rng
could have something to do with magic debuffs on mobs
did u guys coe rogue / priest ?
:peepohigh:
is it just really random
doubt it
do u guys always tank zerevor on top of the stairs?
maybe it has something to do with los
are you sure?
chocolates stack with tbc food?
wrong
pyrestones better for gem bonuses
just hit the mage?
whats up with this spell pen obsession
no it doesnt
ur losing 1.5k dps kiting
its never worth it
you dont have to move
its not made up?
its atleast 1.5k
its strat for chinese gdkps
feel free to use it but its not optimal
yea chocolate rate seems pretty low
:peepohigh:
if you want spell pen setup
you need hatefury mantle
well its needed
if you want optimal setup
just dps caster ?
any idea why MSD doesnt activate?
i have more blue gems than greens/oranges/yellows
https://i.nuuls.com/G-PO4.png
yep we gaming
MSD setup finished
so for MSD green gem only counts as yellow?
https://i.nuuls.com/L3Rmc.png
holy fuck MSD is actually insane
i think oblivion MSD setup is actually insane now
probably should have been using this whole tbc
has to be better than few yellow crit gems
u sure?
wowhead says 6s
so its a bug?
used by item hand of edward the odd?
says nothing about MSD
MSD was changed in later patches
theres a lot of complaining about it
who cares about sims :peepohigh:
seed is all about feelscraft
because haste is best stat for seed
and sp has value in oblivion set
or you wouldnt use oblivion set
no? :peepohigh:
i feelscraft
ill test MSD tomorrow :peepohigh:
youll see
its omega bis
i always try ?
i think should be able to beat mages in hyjal with this
MSD+quags+bowiz
we are looking at insane haste numbers
skull
passive haste from gear
or just put 3x blues in ur oblivion chest
because sp has value assuming ur using oblivion set
crit is dog for seed anyway
2 week notice? :monkaS:
haste is literally 2x better
?
how isnt crit dog
well oblivion set is 820 sp
thats why you use it
on single target bro
destruction spells are affected by ruin talent
seed isnt
im used to it, most people cant just handle the truth
ofc i use crit food in hyjal
ur using felhunter sacc anyway
rarely have to tap
@Severe thats ptr right no way u have that gear
its 2nd best offpiece
after vestments
so keep it
around 10 dps
not a big difference
u gotta delete character first
it is per region
just wake up early
should be no queues
@Healspls i said i wouldnt pay for it
well i have been in queue for 6h now
but it should start going down very fast soon
because people go sleep
or just wake up early
theres no way spell pen ring is worth it bro
mage?
mage can keep aggro just fine
give him 15s
@Soildsr big int difference too
could be that
oh nvm
difference was stam not int
he has hatefury bro
ofc its easy to go spell pen with hatefury
ofc you feed one lock all the pieces
?
is skycrab british
or eastern european
sounds very degen
yes
you actually need to be confident you crit
or you wont crit
its a simulation
we decide what happens
?????
skull is lock ONLY item
you dont give it to any other classes in any case
skull going to non lock is unironically gquit tier
do shamans use BT class trinket
like ZD you could maybe give to a nonlock
if you dont care about optimal loot distribution at all
but skull is lock only
no ZD no cor, no skull no lock
giving ZD to non lock is same as disenchanting it
mage kiting isnt even a real strat
literally lose 1.5-2k dps
wait are mages this stupid
why would they use pipe/icon on hyjal waves
bro
:peepohigh:
how didnt you notice
i had like 150 in early p1 and noticed it
idk guys this MSD setup doesnt seem that good in hyjal atleast
problem is greens count as yellow
but not as blue
so its same as using yellow gem
sure they should but they dont for MSD requirement
oh wait
i actually have 2x yellows on my foretelling boots :monkaS:
greens might work correctly
greens + 1 blue
but i forgot i have foretelling boots with 2x yellows
so thought greens were bugged
you dont have 16 sockets in bis oblivion set
you have like 4 in oblivion pieces
so boots and belt are only gem items on top of that
does reload work
yeah green gems work correctly
so go hybrid crit greens + 1 blue gem for MSD
@Severe how is it supposed to work? just log out having MSD equipped?
no procs in like 20 casts
pretty sure its fixed
or i did something wrong
go test in main game
its 100g
unlucky ur on a dead server
well im pretty sure it doesnt work
does the other gem in helm matter?
i have green in it
yea
helm equipped
didnt change anything
and now when im using correct gems it procced instantly
are you sure the other gem in helm slot doesnt affect it?
can you test it on ptr with green / yellow on helm
well then it doesnt work on live or it doesnt work with oblivion head
or my addon equips some items on login etc
idk
can you test oblivion head on ptr
do you have it
https://i.nuuls.com/N5aXS.png
oblivion has meta gem in 2nd slot
well its fixed then
or im extremely unlucky
didnt work on live atleast when i tested it
seems to work on ptr
nimble thought shoulders help a lot
you can easily go MSD with oblivion now
just gem hybric crit / spell pen in seed items and one blue in oblivion chest
its not overhyped in BT
just need to get cowl
then my omega hyjal seed set is done
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Tbt1VAWQwh9DyJNr#boss=-3&difficulty=0
resulsts from hyjal test
:peepohigh:
i was hard griefed on every boss
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Tbt1VAWQwh9DyJNr#boss=0&difficulty=0
but id say MSD was strong
also no drums whole raid :peepohigh:
no war for warlock
warrior is warr
they arent called warrglaives
never
whose guild
?
go check the replay
we didnt cheese anything
idk why its invalid archimonde
actually gonna go ask our girl kihra
she knows
oh wait
it defaults to our wipe i think
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/QwqHxnkNPMy4BVbK#fight=40
this was the kill
2/4 boys
missing wings tho :pepehands:
with enough haste procs you go oom very fast
bowiz+MSD+quags+skull
passive haste from gear
@Severe wait it actually boosts spell haste ?
can other people still use it on you?
oh
you could rotate in vanilla
have 2 healers use it on you
9g on gehennas
mark of the illidaris
you cant beat melees in that fight
its 0 armor pretty much
and cleave
gotta use infernal early if you want it up for supremus
thats not even many items bro
https://i.nuuls.com/1tbIp.png
:peepohigh:
imagine caring this much about boss parses
when total is the only thing that matters
of course
why wouldnt everyone grab omega bis seed piece
how is it 7k?
i got hearts + pattern from guild
cost me like 2k to lvl tailoring + engi
tailoring was basically free
but im on gehennas so idk
engi is omega cheap too
netherweave was 15-18s
so not expensive at all
no i just disenchanted everything
not even 360-375 was expensive
44g crafting cost and 30g for prismatic shard
so like 200-300g for 360-375
omega omega bis next phase
24.03% passive haste in seed gear
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/9bAFnb5KDPfKTG9D4mi7mg
thats weird
im banned from shadow channel and fight club too
anyways what class are we playing in lost ark
sorceress right bros
well its actually good game
but idk if p2w shit will kill it
english people are degenerated af tho
too long on that island
yoey wants to fuck everything
:peepohigh:
china is already numba wan
USA is soon failed state
eating chinese food :monkaS:
they use gutter oil bro
china has a lot of people
im sure somewhere there they eat sweet n sour pork
and ginger beef
Yeah german rearmament didnt happen before ww2
because of versailles treaty
:peepohigh:
you dont fucking bowiz smuggle with ZD
you dont bowiz smuggle even if you dont have ZD
just because one retards napkin maths say its worth it
doesnt mean its worth it
@Mayhem post one of ur logs with bowiz smuggling
are you serious
5 min lurker?
bro
was it first week or something?
https://i.nuuls.com/yS9tm.png
i dont have 4pc t6
i cant parse 100 or even 99
50% crit isnt enough
you need 4pc t6
its a fact
its a fact
show me 99 from this week
with no 4pc t6
this week?
ok post log bro
no way ur running affli with that comp
actual parse guild?
good guilds dont give a fuck about parses bro
youd be surprised
no one gives a literal fuck about boss parses
parse is literal 0 skill in tbc
its all about comp
like running boomie and aflli is sub optimal for 99% of raids
still people run them for parse memes
bowiz smuggling isnt worth it
go code it mayhem
hildi sim is open source
surely you want to prove everyone wrong
YOU SHOULDNT DO IT
SOMEONE BAN THIS GUY
peak or whole fight 7k?
i was peaking at 11k in hyjal
with MSD setup
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Tbt1VAWQwh9DyJNr#boss=0&difficulty=0
would have been so much better with more aoe classes
its not tho
shadow bolt scales way better than AB
its not even funny
ends up being pretty much same dps upgrade
need helm & pants :pepehands:
archimonde hard griefs
no way bear does enough threat to hold aggro on both of them
its a meme strat
nah
no way
nah you gotta chill a bit on eles
if bear is unlucky
our guild has 4 skulls already
running 3 raids
0 ZD :sadge:
wdym
thats dogshit loot
only good loot from illidan is cloak / zd / skull
0 caster haste belts
:peepohigh:
staff of disintegration sims that high?
its absolute dog
well last time i checked it was pretty much equal with t5 weapon+oh but thats probably because of enchant
if you put soulfrost on it then sure its good
actually im using eye because its better than pipe
on demon bosses i use motc ofc
because its better than eye
forgot to switch
had to switch sacs,food
?
why would i put sapph enchant on nimble thought
its not bis enchant for seeding
scryer enchant is bis for seeding
yep
had to switch sacc, food
my ele didnt even have LW
didnt really care
also used wrong bracers on every boss fight
because same icon
https://i.nuuls.com/i7NPS.png
u guys happy?
you have sapph enchant rdy for t6 right?
idk bro
might go for wings in swp
wings setup is just as good
imagine not having 2x sapph enchants
yes i know it might be hard to understand
but quags is more dps than pipe
just like bowiz smuggling is less dps than playing normally
show me a single good player bowiz smuggling
in a real guild
go sim it
hildi sim is very easy to use
yes vestments is slightly better
but its not a big deal
actually its 5 dps difference
assuming you go 3x reds in legs
no but it makes easier to heal it
have 2-3 stacks
dkp is fun until spriest take skull
for 1 dps upgrade
and replaces it in ZA
doesnt matter
spriest has been hoarding since p1
hes getting the skull
@rubberfish gquit and let them coe and cor
soft res is straight up worst system for guild raids i think
if you win roll on first SR
you get rest of bis for free
chronicle?
:monkaS:
if ur a team player ur going for ZD
and giving toc+chronicle to mages
optimal loot distribution isnt team playing?
GRIEFING raid dps is team play?
@Mayhem you dont cut eles in swp
you want to cut healers
not dps classes
you could also just run healer shaman in ele spec
they dont lose that much
and ur already running holy weaver  at that point etc
raid is only warlock dps
1 support warrior
ofc you will
why not?
you dont run mages in swp
and one mage can survive just fine without spriest in BT
nah
its arcane
just gotta cast a lot of r1 AE and frostbolt
but they can do just fine
you dont run 5 healers in swp
you run 4 maybe
or even 3
you can run 2 blessings no problem
healer output is insane once they get a lot of haste
even BT will be 4 healed
might need some help from prot pala or something on council
but it will be 4 healed
if mana is an issue you give them spriest
@ved 👀
firemaw?
wdym
just want to know if its on firemaw
yea and now calculate how much dps you lose using that shit when ur not using flask on devotion aura
:peepohigh:
yeah bro nice partition
no one will care
i think he could go for spriest too
spriest + boomy + ele + BM hunter
standard comp doesnt run affli
t4 gloves are just horrible horrible piece
if you get t6 i would go with that over t4
assuming you can use the hit
what queues?
just wake up at morning
locks lose literally nothing from blizzard / flamestrike on them
its a free tap
mage kite only benefits melees
often NP procs from flamestrike etc
its a free  tap
do americans REALLY
3 mages wont be meta this phase
meta will be 1 mage tank probably
warrior spikes are nothing compared to warlocks
and haste is insane for seeding
im equal with mages in hyjal
with full haste setup
and in BT its not even close
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Tbt1VAWQwh9DyJNr#boss=0&difficulty=0
MSD is super strong
would have been way higher if we had few more aoe classes
was going oom pretty hard
yea only problem really was that even tapping procs it
so had few out of combat procs
felhound in ally camp
succubus in horde
wdym boosted af?
i was running full haste
2x nimble thought+skull+bowiz+MSD
you go oom very fast
with ~1s seeds
its not worth it
mobs have around 150k hp
its not
when you could be casting ~15-16k seed
aboms have 150k hp bro
you dont coe them
its not 13.7k global
not all dmg is affected by elements
and you want all mobs to die at same time
ok how do you split coe casts perfectly
on hyjal waves
tell me
or just fucking seed them
when its straight up better
nah
you just seed
stop trolling
because i fucked up
they have same icon
thought i switched them on sets but didnt
nah just didnt have correct bracers on boss set
nah
already fixed noticed it after raid
crit / spell pen hybrids
sea spray emeralds were 25g on AH
all greens + 1 blue
easy to do with oblivion atleast
i have orange + blue in blasting
so it doesnt affect MSD
and anyway used pvp belt in hyjal set
for fat int
35s ICD
but yeah
4s duration
well thats just wrong but whatever
CSD is dog for seed
crit is dog for seed
wdym
haste is omega bis for seed
nothing else comes even close
all t6 is dogshit loot
they should just straight up remove physical and healer loot
its literal DE tier
affli just isnt worth it in most comps
its only used by parse guilds
did ahl get glaives yet
dont think hes getting #1 this phase
and what happened to that progress glaive guy
is he doing  INSANE dps with them
yea bro give ele and boomie ZD
then DE all the nashjentus daggers
And DE archimonde shield
nah affli should just respec destro
mayhem ur in a parse guild
i wouldnt type anything at all
yep for sure
ehh once locks get hatefury + 4pc t6
council wont be that bad
but yeah its very good fight for phys
0 armor boss and cleave
0 armor boss
well ur obviously baiting
mage gets magic immunity pretty often
better to just go spell pen and focus gathios
wont be a problem once people get hatefury + t6 chest with epic spell pen gems
no?
you get t6 chest and hatefury mantle
gem them with spell pen
hitting mage is too rng
it might get shield every 30s or never
just hit gathios with spell pen
well pretending to be a retard isnt baiting really spoar
its just being a retard (which you are)
soon they just need glaives
(warlocks wont be getting any upgrades rest of the tbc)
(we wont be doing 4.5k dps in swp)
https://i.nuuls.com/CtvFT.png
thats the top 5
mages still being strong and locks weak
in 4 weeks its going to be purple only
yeah and they removed akamus too
wonder why
but no one cares about boss parses anyway
its all about total dps
is gorefiend low armor boss?
it is a low armor boss right?
?
its still rng when mage gets spell shield
could be every 30s or never
https://i.nuuls.com/LlYwT.png
like thats basically omega unlucky case
and it can happen every week
0 casts on rogue
bro if ur debuffs drop every 30s
and u gotta switch to gathios anyway
its not worth it
i had to cast shitload on magic res gathios even though we focused mage
ur at 138 spell pen with hatefury + t6 chest + elixir + cloak enchant
you dont even need any pvp gear
yeah if you go bob with spell pen ur at capped already
actually ur exactly capped
boots of foretelling work too
no
0 pvp pieces
i already figured out optimal set above you dont worry about it bro
they arent
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/9br39sk1sMQgCFH25x7vb6
realistic spell pen setup
omega bis
its too hard
and barely worth it
might aswell make it easy
council
bro problem is even if debuffs are applied correctly
if ur unlucky it doesnt matter
ur assfucked
just put few spell pen gems on ur gear
and blast gathios
or just stop caring about parses
good guilds dont care about parses that much bro
and why do you need to do gdkps ?
why do you need money?
like what?
i havent done a single gdkp
havent bought any gold
and i have more than enough
not really
i do dailies and raid
raids give shit load of raw gold
@Mayhem faster the guild is better they are
its pretty simple
flasks are literal 9g now
do blade's edge dailies
raid
infinite gold
depends
are locks prio on both+
doesnt matter how many "giga" chad mages you have
ZD and skull are lockp rio
0 ZD 4 skulls :sadge:
our raids have been unlucky
imagine
you steal ZD from ur locks
for 10 dps upgrade
healer upgrade?
is it really an upgrade?
biggest efficiency upgrade is giving locks all the healer haste gear
so raid goes faster
idk cant really cut to 4 healers yet
running too many melees / phys dps
in lock stack you could maybe go 4 healers
what do you mean mage
?
the only t5 comp to run 4 healers was warlock comp
you cant run 4 healers with non warlock comp
has to be a lock comp
lock is hardest class to play optimally in speedruns
gl finding good locks
is 3 target seed actually good with oblivion
probably not good enough to beat t6 shadow bolt tbh
its one fight
warlocks dominate the raid
why optimize for anything?
🤡
mayhem is literally in ahl tier parse guild
ignore everything he says
what?
boomi needs way less hit
fire mage isnt a spec
they boost mayhem parses
affli + boomkin in same raid
you can run one of them
but running both is parse guild
if every lock has skull you roll more lock alts
its lock item.
no
hurricane does like negative dmg
just applies attack speed debuff
its mayhems parse guild
yeah bro hunter simp
when ur running boomie AND affli in same raid
🤡
wand isnt even spell pen bis tho
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/9br39sk1sMQgCFH25x7vb6
this is bis setup
(realistic)
i said realistic
locks should go for haste belt
it is pen cap
you use guardian elixir for 30 sp
spell pen*
idk seen pretty many haste rings already
will have 2 eventually
are u ally xelrog
our guild has like 1000 enhas
if ur running affli you should run moonkin
if ur running moonkin you shouldnt run affli
oblivion on female orc
is top tier
linelo stop griefing ur raid
and give ZD to locks
u guys did math ?
:peepohigh:
and if you love ur raid
you pass ZD
because its bigger upgrade for locks
locks get actually 80 dps
spriests get around 10 dps
yes i know
ur greedy fuck
but you shouldnt be greedy
what
i was the one who invented spell pen strat
im the reason u guys even have spell pen on sim
:peepohigh:
swapping isnt worth it
its too random
yep spriests get free mace+cloak+fat stamina upgrade wand
thats more than enough for one tier
its simple
how much dps does lock gain from ZD
how much does spriest
this is the only question there is
They use mara dagger for holy nova
so ZD would be literally useless
dont worry swp will be better
each boss only has 40 items in pool
hyjal was
its not a meme?
it was released
well it was released effectively
people just couldnt kill KT prenerf
thats a tinfoil theory
it wouldnt be dead?
it would be alive
4 months t4 killed game
how much was the minimum price
i mean why not
its literal DE tier item
shadow cant be faster than light tho
shadow is lack of light
imagine how old you must look after few life taps
:monkaS:
wrong?
skull is 80 dps
glaive is like 200 at best
bro glaive is their swp bis
do you think they are going magically scale after glaives?
gz on his 1 dps upgrade which he will replace in ZA @fjeenzy
does bael even post content in onlyfans
no
+6 stats is bis
you shouldnt focus on minmaxing hyjal dps
minmax BT dps
so its 6%*1.15 with succ?
you only run affli in caster stack speedrun
in every other comp its a parse strat
playing affli in balanced comp is literally wrong
ur raid is doing less dps because someone is affli
if you want to be useful play destro
4 casters?
destro always
affli is maybe worth it around 8-9 casters
rdps is the most important thing to optimize
and most fair thing to optimize
wrong?
no
?
what do you mean
tank wears enough gear to hold aggro and not die
bring enough healers so you can do the raid
but not more
idk if running 4 healers is viable with balanced comps yet
what else would pala gem?
wtf
lock is first prio for 2nd ring anyway
for most classes sage is better
good?
lets hear numbers
whats the dps upgrade of 2nd haste ring for spriests
and what about 1st one
idk how thats right
when for locks its 40 dps first one and 2nd 14 dps
spriest sim undervalues sage?
oh so if crit is shit for spriests why do they want ZD?
its a bait?
so spriests who want ZD are greedy?
so what
10 dps isnt "pretty big"
pvp mace+ badge oh
difference is toc is omega contested
bis for mages , bis for prot palas
and toc literally dead item when seeding
yeah
ele and boomie taking ZD
nice one
ele takes dagger+shield and will be happy
wrong
eles simmed specific haste breakpoint
no other explanation
and ZD is biggest upgrade for locks from p2 bis anyway
and thats the only thing that matters
reward him with dagger+shield
and mail haste belt
and mail boots
yeah if ur a griefer
you would do that
fury copers will force people to run bt
so they can finally equip that glaive OH which has been sitting in bags since week 2
MH ends up never dropping
and they have had that glaive OH sitting in bags since week 3
unlucky
motc is 10 dps upgrade over eye
its not hard but if ur unlucky you are casting on magic res gathios even if you swap
and ur losing debuffs every 30s
yes i think actually simming ur gear is most fair thing
removes all the parse strats and rng
ofc sim setup would be same for everyone
2x lust, no affli
bowiz smuggling is a meme
@Healspls my setup is better
@Healspls https://seventyupgrades.com/set/9br39sk1sMQgCFH25x7vb6
hard to beat solarian wand stats
idk havent simmed
but its all good items
arena items are dog
you pretty much always use the hit from wand
:peepohigh:
you are griefing raid by taking toc+chronicle
@Blow check out solarian wand vs that
oh yeah hes spriest
OH NO NO NO
@Mayhem did you code the bowiz smuggling feature to hildi sim already?
surely you want to prove everyone wrong
show everyone you were right
and everyone else was wrong
so you havent coded it?
why
surely you want to prove ur right
4pc + ZD soon
right now 4pc might be enough
maybe
mayhem you just need to prove it
code bowiz weaving into hildi sim and show the world how smart you are
ok show me bowiz smuggle sim then
haste doesnt affect weapon switch gcd
yep
let the spriest cast coe/cor
well depends
skull on spriest is gquit tier
because skull to spriest is either clc or absolutely clueless lc
why stay in that guild
nah fuck spriests
hard griefing raids by telling people ZD is spriest prio
actual griefers
every spriest should be hyped about 20 stam
(if they werent hardcore greedy griefers)
yeah bro physical dps will be finally viable in swp bro
FINALLY
(warlocks wont be doing 4.5k dps)
warlock is best scaling class
and swp gear is just insane for warlock
every piece is haste+crit+sp
some pieces are haste+crit+sp+hit
imagine playing wotlk
probably will play cata too
u guys are insane
not upgrade at all
keep pipe+quags until you get skull
then use skull+quags
female human lock :peepohappy:
pretty sure wow devs werent thinking
when they added -50% magic dmg aura to boss
and -0% phyiscal dmg aura
rotation
blizz hated locks already back then
any spriest knowers
whats the dps difference of haste belt vs bob with 2x sp gems?
@Pinhead so how big difference?
ur a spriest knower?
so how big
numbers
current and p3 bis
@Hada you need just under 2.000000000000000000000s shadow bolt cast
idk how much haste that is
latency doesnt affect shadow bolt
because of spell queue
delay is 0s if you are using spell queue correctly
https://i.nuuls.com/P7V-f.png
thats whats supposed to happen
well no
because cast time is 2.5s
actually yes
because quags proc is 20%
so any haste item should be good
no you run nether protection anyway
why wouldnt you SS
its 3s cast iirc
person whos doomed runs to warlocks
ur not running anywhere
no one will play wrath
its doa expansion
people will solo heal wotlk with disc priest
making the game even easier
you dont bring hpala
you bring disc priest + few tanks and rest dps
well u gotta still bring 1 shaman
every shaman sucks in wotlk
you still gotta bring 1
if you think wotlk was optimized at all ur delusional
go easy on copium
play lost ark
its free
raid log and get wbuffs
vanilla was absolute dogshit
tbc is way better
its better skull on aoe
You wont have any hit problems in swp
you get hit from boots/belt/bracers
Ring
which is craftable
swp t6 pieces are lock prio anyway
all of swp pieces are OMEGA BIG
hard to pick
literally every piece is omega big
sliver probably
t6 pieces are absolutely insane
everything is insane
well it is
:peepohigh:
https://seventyupgrades.com/character/5HRtLd1Gnwimz5miZwDsYd/set/pnqQU25dCRswq7ECFiQZdR
like every piece is omega big upgrade
sunflare + heart of the pit probably
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/i9mZrn76SqKcU4iVTbDL3d
:peepohigh:
on horde you want oranges/blues in every 1/2 socket items
you can go 3x reds in socket items
but oranges+purple is fine there too
why is it always a gnome
:peepohigh:
!skull
!zhardoom
most mods hate locks
they are undercover mages
ZD is 80
skull is 80 if you use the hit
isnt sarthe from sb
they lost their only good locks
and now are forced to run phys meme comp
warlock discord is the only good class discord
every other discord is super biased
so why was i removed?
all my arguments were based on facts
(which spriests dont obviously like)
i think mages will try to shill fire once they start getting destroyed on meters
its already starting to happen
idk if they can cope with it
0 utility class
and youll reopen it
in swp
once people ask question why do we bring mages?
mages utility is literally int scroll
why do you bring a walking int scroll when you could bring a lock
yeah all that aoe in swp
and locks are starting to beat mages on aoe too
bael does wowhead guides?
mages go to bench in swp
walking int scroll
this is what i meant by the mage cope btw
ehh
mage is unironically benched in swp
wouldnt give them skull
@Foolipe locks get just as much if not more from ZD+skull on aoe
probably more
mages dont even run eye
because mages need hit
they dont want to tell this little secret to anyone
but infact they do need hit
mages have TLC+ashtongue+MQG
locks have nothing
who should get skull for aoe
or they just take toc+chronicle
???
wear good items
those are omega low
you did something wrong
https://i.nuuls.com/PvRn6.png
160-210 sim
1 lust
because pretty much everyone uses same settings
https://i.nuuls.com/OLfBV.png
shamans will use 2pc t4 im pretty sure
you didnt sim catabolt?
isb is 70%
omega omega low
switch to catabolt and atleast 80% isb
exactly the same means fire is dead
even if its few dps better
its dead
and you want NP in swp
affli isnt enabled in the basic settings
@Valethar time to go holy weaver
idk bro
raiding without misery and shadow vulne is pretty scuffed
gotta go fire
and mage arc/fire
well i would use skull+quags
just use quags
more dps and easier to play
im using mainly skull+motc
if i didnt have motc i would use quags
dont use it on archi if going BT after
you want to use it atleast on supremus
its free 180 dps
deaden? whats that
never seen it
we dont parse
fury cant hold aggro
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Tbt1VAWQwh9DyJNr#boss=0&difficulty=0
this was my MSD test
id say its very good
mystical skyfire diamond
its not that bad for seeding
crit has dog value and you can use crit / spell pen hybrids
well there are decent haste shoulders in ZA
but nimble thought is better
imagine playing wotlk
ngmi
:peepohigh:
do you have 4pc t6
pipe user
how are you critting 9.1k
?
oh eternal sage
this reminds me maybe i should go farm it
missing 6k rep
it was omega bis on fire bro
and with haste?
yeah that was pretty much known week 1
but good to test it
so retards like mayhem finally understand bowiz smuggling is a meme
what log
and some noobs probably are bowiz smuggling because of him right now
:peepohigh:
you dont bowiz smuggle when seeding
you equip it out of combat
and keep it equipped
assuming you dont have ZD
no
you keep ZD equipped
more crit more sp more int
mages are disappearing already
they dont get any upgrades
other classes get upgrades
problem is mage really doesnt scale with haste
and swp is mainly haste
and ofc they have to wear dogshit 2pc t5
prenerf with no muru pushback means locks are god tier
if pushback is in then its a small problem
imagine the qol if we had good drums day 1
but blizz unironically is too fucking clueless
we did illidan with pala tank and no affli week 1
you never needed SE
ofc you are on trash
destro and affli is pretty much the same on aoe
go destro
affli is only worth it in caster stack
+8 casters
are you using infernal on supremus?
i think mayhem should just be banned for trolling and spreading misinformation
casters that benefit from coe
so everyone expect ele
why is spell haste more valuable in reliquary p2?
this is why we use bowiz smuggling term
just perma ban mayhem and be done with it
if you want to minmax ur dps yes seed sets are worth it
t6 is for single target
you still want to use oblivion for seeding in BT
in hyjal max haste / crit setup
ehh
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/raNY2roLBR58oQNrTb76XX
not so sure about that
pressing shadow bolts with oblivion is massive loss
with ZA haste set its not that big deal
MSD
MSD is very good
im using MSD right now
seems to be working pretty good
its only 3 / 5 crit per gem slot
no that big deal
you can drop engi lvl tailoring craft shoulders drop tailoring lvl engi
thats what i did
engi was like 1k on gehennas
and tailoring was like 300-400g
haste breakpoint doesnt even exist for spriests
muru robe
but if ur not going for muru robe you kinda want JC neck
you want to use quags
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/raNY2roLBR58oQNrTb76XX
and this is better anyway
well p3 is just oblivion+nimble thought shoulders and haste > crit in other slots
well aoe capped is just max haste > crit
shouldnt really care about hyjal that much
if ur seeding in BT you should be using oblivion
unless you know you have to cast a lot of shadow bolts in that fight later
no akama is aoe capped and u gotta cast many shadow bolts
use normal boss gear
ur capped aoe set has 164 hit?
no way its worth it
just use normal boss gear especially if u have 4pc t6
show us ur stats on normal boss gear vs aoe capped set
difference wont be that big
destro on illidan
on other bosses usually mana pot
bro theres no way its 300 sp difference too
ur missing something
and theres literally no way its 9% crit difference
@Maou bro ur set is dog
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/raNY2roLBR58oQNrTb76XX
share this
differences are pretty big
ur not running meta gem
use nimble thought shoulders and oblivion legs
its non capped set
sp has value
or he wouldnt use oblivion
8 mobs = capped , 7 mobs = maybe capped , 6 = not capped
bob isnt bis
if you have bis gear
https://i.nuuls.com/VOuUv.png
this is bis basically
can use noose instead of infinity
its few dps difference but waistwap is better for aoe
what the fuck guys
mana pot is better in most fights
illidan is only fight where destro is always better
if fight is 2:10 - 2:20 then destro into mana pot might be better
but its close
if fight is under 2 min mana pot is better in most cases
you have free taps on council and gurtogg
but i seem to go oom on gurtogg anyway
/use mana potion injector
/cast shadow bolt
/cqs
theres ur mana pot macro
not very hard to use
demonic rune is literally 1/3 of mana pot
if you think demonic rune is good surely ur using mana pots
warlocks go oom omega fast
even with catabolt
you dont need rank
#showtooltip Mana Potion Injector
/use Cenarion Mana Salve
/use Bottled Nethergon Energy
/use Mana Potion Injector
/use Super Mana Potion
/use Auchenai Mana Potion
/cast Shadow Bolt
/cqs
this is my shadow bolt macro
#showtooltip Mana Potion Injector
/use Cenarion Mana Salve
/use Bottled Nethergon Energy
/use Super Mana Potion
/use Mana Potion Injector
/use Auchenai Mana Potion
/cast Seed of corruption
/cqs
seed macro
you dont want trinket in mana pot
mages have ashtongue,MQG, pipe/icon, moro trinket,TLC for aoe
locks have skull and quags
you actually want him being arcane
because they scale like dogshit with gear
@sassenagh i use them for using mana pots in combat
without cqs macro doesnt work always
and if you dont macro it ur going ot have big gap
@sassenagh what do you mean
eles get nice dagger and shield
nice mail belt & boots
thats more than enough
no you replace ur mana potion button with those macros @sassenagh
never use /cqs in ur main ability macro because it disables spell queue
mayhem has been spreading misinformation
he should be banned from this discord
or maybe the person who spreads misinformation should be banned
even you the master bowiz smuggler cant do it correctly
how could anyone else do it
i just want my brown warrior role back
and this is why mayhem should have been banned long time ago
baiting other people into bowiz smuggling
bowiz smuggling
dont use mayhems term
bowiz smuggling
"boweaving" term might make people think its viable strat when its not
its bowiz smuggling
guys :monkaS:
might have been top 1 in world fastest run
(on my alchemy alt mage)
p3.5
were faster than p3 anyway

world #1 mage
https://www.twitch.tv/gussepeikko
streamed
top 1 mage in top 1 speedrun
thats the best mage
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/LGyfZVtMJmD7vXdp#boss=-3&start=423&end=4487750&type=damage-done
seems pretty good to me
none of the locks were geared
what fight is that
10 mins
im world #1 mage and skull is lock prio.
good guilds speedrun
not parse
wrong
or you simply dont give a fuck about parses
asstongue isnt fixed right
dont see anything on blue-tracker
OH NO NO NO
mages thinking their bug will get fixed
when seed still isnt fixed
OH NO NO NO NO
@Scanlawn how does it feel to get farmed by alchemy alt 0 t6 loot
world best mage is lock main
oh no no
Everyone takes NP
shouldnt even see demon phase anymore
p2 has pushback
p1 is literally 0 armor
most locks dont have 4pc t6 yet
or zd and skull
just get more hyjal cloaks
@Mentis did you see im officially the best player & mage in the world
too bad poe is literally dead now
and how many hours did you play
is zephan british
does he have f pass
do they have f pass
yea they have been smoking f words for long time
they are like worse version of british
nothing wrong with nuclear power
its the most green thing we can do
actually im the best player in world
on alchemy alt
its my alchemy alt
was scuffed af
we summoned people for 3 mins
hunter pulled many packs
im the best mage & player in the world
imagine caring about boss parses
@Bergtau why are locks best performing class in speedruns then
yes and speedrun is the only content there is in this game
dont worry illidan will have 18m hp in tbc som
imagine not picking flowers,cutting trees and mining copper in lost ark
:peepohigh:
NGMI
just like no pver gives a shit about pvp accomplishments
you have a nice guild if someone takes vestments for seed set over lock alt
when vestments isnt even bis for seeds sets
most guilds have mediocre locks
its the hardest class to play optimally
if you care about overall
its hardest
hunter really isnt a speedrun class
mainly there for pulls and one MD
meta will be lock stack and pulling 3-4 packs at same time
nota wasnt even top 10
because they ran meme comp
🤡
thing is you can easily bring 13 locks
bringing many warriors is hard
dont see mages being meta
they really need innervate or have to eat % food all the time
you need 1 mage
for council
mana pot is 1.5g and its massive dps upgrade
for overall
should always mana pot when seeding
it was maybe possible with haste gems
but not without
vestments setup is 5 dps better
you finally started to use quags?
nice
so mayhem whats ur take on haste not affecting weapon switch GCD
surely this is a problem for bowiz smuggling ??
dont run cowl
you wont have wings
well i dont have brown warrior role do i have
:peepohigh:
and its not brown
everyone has skull
i want my brown warrior role back
ofc the greedy spriest doesnt care about raid
:peepohigh:
wants ZD but wont help people farm bis
every lock in ur guild has vestments?
every physical dps has belt?
fury prot cant intercept
???
they cant
they cant mocking either easily
KEK
rogue is doing imp ea on pre hydross trash too right?
do italians really care about these things
you always use oblivion when seeding in BT
pre mother 🤡
maybe get one seed off
its not the warrior brown
:peepohigh:
and i dont have the role
fix these issues jannies
mage will insta pop every seed
pala sapper too
crit is useless stat tho
if you crit it did nothing and if you dont it did nothing
no it didnt
it could have been crit with 0 crit from gear/talents
yeah
hit and crit are useless stats
:peepohigh:
only haste and spell power are good stats
reapply every 6s
you get gaps if you put in on every shadow bolt
@Jose you go helm or shoulders in swp
dont use tabard
show helm
show cloak
only way to use oblivion set
maybe its bis on locks
:peepohigh:
mages have infinite mana anyway
🤡
spriest been saving dkp since P1 for skull
and kills the guild
dkp is great system guys
you cor big demons basically
dont think theres anything else you should really cor
maybe do one global before seeds
???
ofc you save 24 year old
women and children arent 73 year old
human nature is to not save 73 year old person
???
you would never save 73 year old
hes basically dead already
its simple human nature
only if ur specced
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Ph69RNZfnLtYBHgb/#boss=-3&difficulty=0
id say MSD works pretty well
didnt even have 4pc t6
:peepohigh:
oblivion + seaspray emerald hybrids
nothing special rly
@Jujutsu more than any other class
dont worry about it
https://i.nuuls.com/fQlgq.png
been using this head whole tbc btw
see whats wrong with it
:Pepeclown:
yea but thats not the problem
i have been using melee crit
:peepohigh:
atleast my guildie finally noticed it
start using MSD fellow warlocks
it pumps
@Caligula https://seventyupgrades.com/set/g9gHadwiBeG7oNPsa1ixDt
stop shit posting :peepohigh:
why didnt people start using MSD earlier
its actually insANE
yea
you dont lose any spell power
you lose very small amount of crit
which is dog for seeding anyway
you dont "want" SP
but its not 0 gain
35s ICD on msd
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/Ph69RNZfnLtYBHgb#boss=-3&difficulty=0
results are very good
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/GY6mWCzRXrFvb3Vj
sp is very low value
crit is kinda lowish
and haste is omega value
you will only enter tap rotation faster with low raid dps
and it doesnt matter if you tap with few mobs alive
you want to get as many seeds out as fast as possible every fight
:peepohigh:
ur trolling
you always use mana pot when seeding
you oom unless ur fel succubus sacced
i run oom in like 15s with haste procs
spriest is bis buff for seed
assuming no felhound sacc
affliction has better seed
36 range is omega big for seed
wrong
in BT there are many situations where i wish i had 36 range on seed
@Pomeu it does dmg
basically free dmg
imagine moving during aoe pulls instead of just seeding
:peepohigh:
You can get shards on ros
literally FREE shards
yea its bis
:peepohigh:
spire + shield
toc + shit
another reset another dogshit loot
0 lock items dropped
toc is mage item
@Jujutsu how are mages coping with the fact that locks are better now
they are
https://i.nuuls.com/XiENX.png
yeah most guilds have shit locks
ofc?
:peepohigh:
who elses log should i link
ur fury is doing 2.1k total?
can u link the log
and im dogshit geared
not even 4pc t6
no ZD
no haste belt
its 2x bm grp fury?
with every support class in the game
and idk about this 2h run
probably waited deathwish for every fight
so its his parse guild
thats just fine
dont post parse logs
seed just hits so much harder than AE
its not even fair
not many lock is bis geared yt
and MSD isnt meta yet
even though its insane for locks
idk why no one tested in t5
:peepohigh:
locks have been #1 dps since p1
on all metrics
most used in speedkills, most used in speedruns
thats the thing juju
t5 bis and t6 bis for mage is literally the same
its a nonscaling class
nonscaling classes always get cocky
its not 100 dps?
ur wrong
ZD is 80 dps for lock
for mage maybe 30 dps
if that
cant trust mage sims
its not 100 dps
its at best 30 dps in real game
show ur whole sim page
lets see it how mage is cheating this time
its my alch alt
in speedrun test
total is all about going fast rn
most guilds are running splits
cba to open that
screencap ur page
both
mage sim has asstongue bug?
it actually has it?
actually going to need use ur link
so i can debunk this
oh its ally
found it
now ur going to gem hit to make toc seem worse right?
:peepohigh:
the mage classic
:peepohigh:
somethings wrong here
havent seen mage simming 3k
number i have seen is 2.8k
so you have cheated somehow
NUMBER OF INNERVATES
PUT IT TO 1
ur not actually simming 2 innervates
:peepohigh:
this is how mages do it every time
never trust a mage
put it to 1
you could if ur in a parse guild
no one gives a single fuck about parse guilds
okay
thats more like it
i found out how a mage cheated
and sim is correct now
@Jujutsu disable malediction
no one runs affli
no one runs affli in a real guild
disable it and post results
mage using the oldest sim trick in book
ticks on infinite mana and stacks haste
and has malediction
he said ZD is 100 dps for mages
even though its not
ofc i would pass on my mage
its literally an alchemy alt
check my gear skycrab
and it wasnt even a speedrun
literally no one gives a fuck about boss dps
mages are nonscaling class
ofc they are better when neither class has t6 gear
@Jujutsu why am i beating you by 200 dps then
without even trying
just run holy weaver if no spriest
you really want spriest or holy weaver
but if its casual guild idk if holy weaver will work
who else would take ZD?
and aoe dps difference is massive
80 if you can use the hit
but on aoe its actually insane
well wrong
ZD is single biggest upgrade
4pc t6 is biggest upgrade
yeah but its the biggest upgrade we get this phase
well almost every t6 piece is bis too
imagine playing male draenei
when you could play female draenei
wow they are adding ZA?
who could have known
they wanna push out wotlk out this year
so they are rushing tbc
after having us farm p1 for 5 months
well its not
tbc is their last money maker
wotlk is dead 1 month in
nothing compared to wotlk
once people understand its about 100x easier than tbc classic
no one is staying
???
why would using a spell invalidate ur logs
is chicken a spell?
well poly isnt banned
@Maou ofc it is worth it?
it has 7k jp
hp
will die to pack after supremus
its not
you want to prepop it
0 ZDs from 12 resets
:peepohigh:
theres no reflective shield on mage
imagine quags+skull+bowiz+drums+MSD snapshot
whats the haste cap on hellfire
but the cast doesnt get any shorter
you just get faster ticks
pretty sure it doesnt
ok i think cast is actually shorter
with haste
you dont run 3 mages in optimal comp anymore
only 1 for council tanking
i think 3 tanks will be meta
2x prots is very good for locks
and brings 2 blessings
which you need anyway
no one speedruns atm
its splits
imagine if sp totem stacked too
parsing would be so degen
they still dont show up on meters
its whatever
they should put 20 sp totem up before boss
and switch to 4pc t6
they do 1050 dps instead of 1000 probably
ehh dont care
if running 4 locks + ele
2pc t4 is like 130 dps
4pc t6 is around same number
hildi sim is the best
every other sim is actual dogshit
nah casuals quit long time ago
no one plays retail anymore
expect mythic world first raiders
i dont hate retail tho
my friend is biggest blizz drone there is
and even he quit retail and only plays classic now
set bonus is worth around 30 sp
2 good t6 loots should be better than 2pc t4
pretty sure its just full random
like how do you think blizz coded it?
idk why u guys are discussing council once again
when you should be discussing using MSD instead of CSD on seed set
:peepohigh:
using MSD instead of CSD on ur seed set is like 100 dps upgrade on total
and you talk about council
spell pen is scuffed as fuck without hatefury
@Stabile difference between hatefury and nonhatefury sets is too massive
it just doesnt work
and its dogshit compared to hatefury
oh im doing it
but lock discord is discussing council again
instead of taking free +100 dps upgrade on total
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/qopy5aXdUrhbg92E8TRqZ6
its not hard
hardest part is seeing ZD or haste belt / cloak even drop
havent seen single one
:peepohigh:
just linked the set
xelrog is retarded if he doesnt see how good MSD is
crit is dogshit stat for seed
no you go full haste
because seed scales like shit from crit/sp
you cant sim seeding on trash packs really
its a feelcraft thing
dont need to sim it
i feelcrafted it
yea ur going MSD in few weeks
once you apes see its massive
you simmed 20-25s fights?
you simmed mobs dying
ur not wasting naything
anything
you are getting 320 haste 4s proc
for free
crit is wasted
its dogshit compared to haste
ur not giving "a lot of crit"
you are giving small amount of crit for a lot of haste
35s ICD
yea procs even off tap
but you should aim to tap while its on ICD
when 1-2 mobs are alive and ur running to next pack
i just dont understand how no one tested it during t5
its so obvious
@Stabile now do bowiz+quags+skull
and anyway just test it in a raid
and you see how good it is
and 2/3 extra seed every 40s sounds pretty good to me
🤡
xelrog doesnt undertand how haste works in 2022
lets assume fight lasts 25s
4s of 320 haste is pretty big during that
you dont need basic math
do MSD setup
go pump in a raid
and you see how good it is
its simple
well the conclusion is MSD is worth it
no it was always worth it
no one just tested it in t5
people always shilled quags
when MSD is the same thing
wrong?
4 crit per gem ,5 crit now
quags vs sextant is almost same difference
yea i did
im just wondering why no one else tested it earlier
3% crit dmg 🤡
u guys simmed 25s fights with bowiz+quags+MSD ?
or 20s
or 15s ?
they proc always early in the fight
more haste you have faster you get other haste procs
and you want to get as many seeds off as early as possible
because mobs die
because thats realistic fight length on t6 packs
if you dont want to do more dps
dont use MSd
i dont care
if you want to do more dps, use MSD
because of ruin
what start?
pre supremus trash?
theres barely any seed packs pre supremus
no difference is MSD
and they are on cor/coe
probably casting it too much
stop misgendering kihra
she has cat girl profile pic so shes a female
you cant sim it really
from incinerate?
yea if you want to do more dps go MSD
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/qopy5aXdUrhbg92E8TRqZ6
my current setup
nah i use it in BT
hyjal is no oblivion crit/haste MSD setup
@jerggy its just random crit gear instead of oblivion
robe of hateful echoes etc
dont care about hyjal that much anyway
other is pumper lock and other is alt
wait that log?
its 3 alt locks with me
but they are better than 99% of locks
(not that that is hard in anyway)
oh they all do have seed sets
its mostly 1-2 mobs alive taps
cba to cast even on them
yea it does insane threat
if no pumper pala you will pull aggro
:peepohigh:
what are these dog sets
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/qKn5Bq8bVfvrzSNFEtJNhW
this is realistic
and bis (realistic)
after locks
spriest+holy priest+2 palas want t6
its very quick to get t6 chest for free
why would someone even run gdkps
gold is literally useless
World first race is kinda boring now
if it goes to 2nd reset limit insta wins
kills all the hype
well if its going to 2nd reset limit already won
for free
echo had to kill it first week
or limit insta wins
do you understand how cancer it is to remake new characters every time for ptr
you gotta buy all the gear
all the consumables
no oils
setup talents
mages just cant cope with the fact that warlocks are better
its sad
mages are thinking they wont be benched if they go frost in swp
oh no no no no
sure it is if you want to deal less dps than warlocks while taking their gear
mage is dogshit in swp*
frost is their latest cope
nah mages finally understood arcane is 0 scaling spec
so they think they can go frost and steal all the warlock loot
thats a cope
warlock literally doesnt need any support
has mage discord simmed replacing mages with locks yet
4pc t6 locks talking about parses
absolute state of this discord
t6 gloves + anything is almost upgrade
because t4 gloves are dogshit
never trust a mage
never
my alchemy alt?
actually i was worlds best player on my alchemy alt for a while
its my alchemy alt
:peepohigh:
@Vertalian skull is lock only item, ZD is lock prio
easy
wdym loot whores
:peepohigh:
locks just benefit most from loot
:peepohigh:
if you take toc as lock ur a griefer
and dont care about whats best for the raid
wait
prot pala has toc?
doesnt matter if mages dont want it
thats what they get
ofc they are
mages are hardcore raid griefers
i thought you were first on ZD @Blow
did you get cucked
are you doing seed strat on akama?
getting double lust?
:monkaS:
why doesnt internet work
are nukes flying
only discord and twitch works
yea warcraftlogs
posting hyjal dps?
is this the power of mages
posting hyjal
memento + mace :peepohigh:
you just know it
literal wasted ID incoming
you JUST know it
its ur guild id
thats how loot is seeded
@Davos only way to fix it is remaking the guild
or forget about it
no
its not first person
you cant prove it
blizz fucks us behind the scenes
holy weaver and healing ele is 7 support classes?
interesting
https://i.nuuls.com/jUDni.png
this hit hurts
:peepohigh:
ehh foretelling is very close to boots of blasting
even if ur not using hit at all
im not tailoring
:peepohigh:
4pc t6 is pretty normal by now
everyones going to have it in 2 weeks
???
how is it not
1 4pc to prot pala
and rest to locks
and you prio one lock
and next week its 2 locks
in 2 weeks its 3 locks
2/4 becomes 4/4 very fast
1/4 becomes 4/4 very fast
no way
top 1% is 2x ring+skull+zd+4pc t6
haste cloak
boots & belt
neck
got hatefury mantle too
:peepohigh:
cant use it until i get t6 chest
yes but im not top 1%
i got cucked on ZD too
should have gotten it
no got it today
no way
im still in mostly p2 gear
no zd = no insane gear
its that simple
wdym
we run 3 raids
we have like 5-6 skulls atm
many haste rings
and its week 5 4pc t6
:peepohigh:
just wear rocket boots
and dont fucking grief on spriest
go full shadow res
:peepohigh:
dont die
thats ur job
decent
got cucked on ZD
atleast got 4pc t6 and hatefury
:peepohigh:
i was banned for being too based
fightclub wasnt ready
and they were bunch of retards
discord was dogshit anyway
never did that bael 🙂
i would never say such a thing 🙂
so stop lying please
???
its literally not true
bael is lying and spreading misinformation
literally everyone can do bear runs in classic
literally EVERYONE will have one
its 3 days reset
well hes griefing his dps
i wouldnt
waste of shards
@Blow nice you disenchanted ZD
:peepohigh:
literally disenchanted ZD
what a guild
skull ZD and roak all disenchanted
sad
good games like?
dont say elden ring
Lost ark is good game
@Blow whens ur next raid with ZD
i want to see the massive dps upgrade spriest gains from ZD
yeah disenchanting ZD is smart
he wants the dagger
not ZD
no he wants dagger.
most people dont know what they want
boomies want dagger
who the fuck gives a fuck whats bis for someone
boomies want dagger
za should be 3 days
thats what i have heard atleast
ehh most of the gear is dog compared to t6 stuff
only trinket is really good
illidan cloak is better
all t6 cloaks probably better
@Foncho these caster version too
yea
trinket
thats it
sure theres good haste seed gear
its very close to oblivion when no capped i think
to go with haste gear
bis seed weapon is ZD
bowiz is better than that
but ZD is bis seed weapon
yes it is because haste is pretty good stat for seed
@Kullidan doesnt share cd with anything
i have quag+bowiz+MSD sometimes all at same time
do you play bard bael
nice parse guild
why would spriest have ele
:peepohigh:
what rank are u guys
no way ur serious
well can you mount there?
who cares if you stream or not
ofc because warlocks are best class in tbc
they will be
only brought for council
overclock tried mage stack on world first race
but its just worse than warlock stack
theres literally 0 reason to bring mage over lock if dps is even close
and in t6 bis lock will outdps mages
so you bring one for council tanking
0 in swp
no one was even close in p2
but progress was pretty much only one running optimal comp
people will probably run optimal comps in t6
have fun waiting for lusts
speedkills isnt chill at all
you are mainly waiting for lusts
and chain wiping
ZA wont affect BT that much
you get very few upgrades from there
we had just as many casts when we used mage kiting
maybe even more
you can always use the hit neck
yea that ring is actually pretty good
yes infact MSD is better
greens + 1 blue
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/8Y8GR55ozLqYVG7ik8b9Bi
this is the set im using right now
no warlock without vestments is the highest prio
especially if ur not running vashj anymore
if its 20 dps upgrade for a lock its not 20 dps upgrade for boomie
and?
if its 20 dps for lock, its not 20 dps for boomie
its simple as that
well crit too
and sp
and ofc hit
locks just scale the best from all stats
well if you dont have t6 that works
but optimally you want hatefury+4pc t6
t6 chest with 3x spell pen gems
no idea
theres a very good haste ring with hit in ZA
and most people wont have 2x roak
when we did mage kiting it happened just as often
maybe mage did it wrong idk
doesnt she just cast more flamestrikes / blizzards when shes moving all the time
because shes not casting arcane bolts
132 + elixir
jannies
:peepohigh:
dont even know basic consumables
its like 8g here
who cares
no ones bringing hunters to speedruns
only parsebrains care
fire isnt viable spec
fire steals all the lock loot and deals less dps
brings 0 utility
no
you can only continue in that ID
so blow when are u raiding with ur new ZD
world needs to see massive dps gains from spriest ZD
are you ready to disprove the world
and show them ZD isnt 10 dps increase for spriest
wow roak + ZD
this must be atleast 20 dps
could it be even 30 dps???
i tried to redpill spriests on the fact that they dont scale
AT ALL
and they banned me
its almost sad
its not 32 dps for priest
you wont
you coper cant handle the truth
but normal people can see what i type
spriests gain maybe 10 dps from roak
MAYBE
@Stabile whats ur guild
i need to see this massive 30 dps upgrade he got from roak
@Stabile when did he get it?
and what his name
i dont literally give a fuck if you give a fucka bout my opinions
im talking about facts
https://i.nuuls.com/0YRdJ.png 
no roak,


https://i.nuuls.com/IqtcS.png
roak
can someone explain this
why did him getting roak lead to 10 dps loss?
zhardoom is 40 dps for spriest?
no way
OH ON NO NO
do spriests actually believe this shit?
No way
maybe in sim
in real game its more like 20 dps
45 dps upgrade for spriests is massive
no way its 45 dps
they are doing like 1k dps
spriests should be shilling holy weaving anyway
idk why they arent doing it
can someone ask linelo why isnt he shilling holy weaver
when its the best priest spec
ofc spriest retard doesnt understand haste
CLASSIC
spriests dont see themself on meters
no matter how many bis items they have
???
you deal more dps if you have roak
ofc you notice yourself doing more dps
yea sp upgrades are very noticeable
very
ban this guy
hes just using buzzwords
idk why u guys even argue
linelo comes here and trolls
and spreads false information
Forced to take cowl?
oh no no no no
oh no no no
wheres ur vestments bro
wheres ur skull
have fun playing with no wings
should have taken channeled elements atleast
MSD on st?
Bro
you have to use CSD on st
because of ruin
on seed sets you use MSD ofc
MSD is omega bis for seeding
???
https://seventyupgrades.com/set/omie4GgHb7ZspdfMfxs5RN
its so easy now
problem is people just simmed MSD vs CSD
when you really cant sim seeding
once you try MSD its obvious its better
