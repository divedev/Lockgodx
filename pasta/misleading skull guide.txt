Hey
Your article on wowhead is very misleading imo
It completely ignores that skull+oh+icon, given that you need both zd and skull. Further it ignores the usefulness of toc + oh for future content.
Further, the haste on skull (or any haste in general) makes warlocks go into the tap Rotation faster, which is a significant downside for haste on locks vs haste on mages Only looking at the Sims from an alliance Pov also greatly devalues skull for mages, which is misleading.
Last but not least I think giving any class that cannot do proper AoE (e.g. boomies) a high rank on those Banger items like skull and ZD is really really bad.
I usually value your opinion, research, and theorycraft, but this article is missing out very very much critical thinking and imo it reads like a "100 reasons to give warlocks skull first - written by a warlock"
