here's the way things are for lvling in tbc

questing with succ for mana drain
ur basically just leeching off ur sugar mommy dominatrix while she's chillin in a corner being completely useless. u prolly have a findom and humiliation fetish. reevaluate ur self-worth king/queen, ur worth more than this.

questing with felpup for mana drain
ur abusing ur good loyal doggo for marginal gains bc ur too cheap to life tap. it's just trying to do the best job it can by spell lockin casters and keepin u / them clean of magic, but no u gotta slap it around for 500 mana. 3/10

questing with imp
ur a degenerate who probably has an onlyfans subscription to several 4' nothing girls w/ annoying uwu voices. absolutely haram behaviour, pls shower more often.

questing with voidwalker
thank you for boosting a warlock to 58, pls select a role and check the pins for more info.

questing with felguard
ur double-teaming hoes with ur best bro crushin nerds while cracking open cold brews, half-drunk and ready to throwdown any poor misguided soul(s) who dare to think they can take you down. ur a wwe tag-team that legends are made of.

questing with no pets / sacced pets
ur a m*ge, pls dm me so i can permamute u.
