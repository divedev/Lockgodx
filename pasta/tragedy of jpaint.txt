Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Jpaint the wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Mages would tell you. It's a Warlock legend. Darth Jpaint was a Dark Lord of the Warlocks, so powerful and so wise he could use the Discord to influence the masses to spec fire... He had such a knowledge of the theorycraft that he could even prevent the ones he cared about from ignorance. The dark side of the Spreadsheet is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice banned him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from misinformation, but not himself.
