Honestly. I need to say something. This star farming battle needs to end. We have lost sight of what is truly important. Shitposting. The starboard stood as a bastion for this greats discords annals for the finest fecal laced posts ever produced. The star board was never about power or fame. I never reached top of the start board looking for fame, I did it for the love of the shitpost. Nowadays all we focus on is numbers. We infight over getting to the starboard, our standards have slipped for the sake of a proxy war. We need to settle our differences and coexist together. As posters and consumers of shit.
