You know what would make me feel depressed? If I was a hardcore fire cultist and I came to the realisation that I'm losing ground not just in the grand scheme of things, but also in detail constantly. ISB uptime is improving weekly, daily, probably even as I'm writing this the average ISB uptime across all raids in the world of warcraft is improving as shadowchads are picking up more and more items with spellcrit rating. You are losing literally as you're reading this because someone in some raid out there just got fathstome. You are losing, losing and losing - constantly. You have been losing, you are losing and you will be losing until the very end of the expansion. Every breath you take, every incinerate you cast, every imp you sac you are LOSING. ISB uptime is increasing constantly just like the sun is expanding, ironically things will get too hot for you fire warlocks and you will go extinct just like the dinosaurs, except that noone will miss you. Personally? I couldn't handle it. But that's why I chose not to be a loser. I'm a winner. A shadow destro chad.
