Ladies and gentlemen we have the best ISB numbers. I ran the numbers myself. My numbers are so accurate they would make zephan look like a kenneth sim. The numbers are very good let me tell you. You wouldn't even believe me if i did show you these numbers. Shadow lock is very very good. All these other warlocks oh wheres my scorch wheres my this wheres my that im telling you folks all you need to worry about is to just trust in the numbers. My uncle was a simulator himself you know. He built the very first warlock damage meter. He explained to me that you can only apply ISB when you cast shadowbolt. Casting shadowbolt means the damage of shadow spells increases and you just cant have that as fire.
