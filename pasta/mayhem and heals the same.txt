Here's the thing. You said "Heals and Mayhem are the same person."

Are they in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies shitposters, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one compares heals with mayhem. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same.
If you're saying "troll family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Trolidae, which includes things from spamming pastas to shitposts to flamebait.

So your reasoning for associating Heals with Mayhem is because random people "call the black ones crows?" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A shitposter is a shitposter and a member of the troll family. But that's not what you said. You said a shitposter is a troll, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the troll family trolls, which means you'd call flamebaiters, spammers, and other warlock regulars trolls, too. Which you said you don't.

It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?
