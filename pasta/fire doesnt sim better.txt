Fire doesn't sim better.
And if it does, I never saw it on pserver.
And if I did, it always did less damage.
And if it didn't, it was because ISB uptime was low.
And if it wasn't, it still won't be true in Classic TBC.
And if it is, week one logs aren't worth considering.
And if they are, that doesn't prove anything.
