The year is 2021. You look at the dsicord. lockcord admin President Zephan announces a role mandate for employees. You clutch your limited edition Dive Funko Pop. It has begun. You gather up all your sims, and jump into your truck, hitting the highway for the airport. Out of your rearview mirror you can make out an orange crab pursuing you. You make out the numbers “1” “9” “8” and 4” on their license plate. You are able to lose the crab and arrive at the airport. You are almost free. At airport security You see a young lock being dragged away screaming. The guards yell something about him having a fire mage. Thankfully you only have an AR 15 on you. The guard inspects it.
“It’s for hunting,” you say.
They hand it back to you and wave for you to move along. You breathe a sigh of relief.
“One more thing.”
You turn to see a Guard staring down at you with their beady soulless eyes.
“I need to see your c*m card”
It is too late. You try to run away, but you feel someone press a cloth against your face. Reality fades away. You wake up in some kind of lab, chained down to an operation table and gagged. The room is undecorated except for a single poster of Kenneth in a dress on the wall. A single figure stands in the corner shrouded in shadow, fiddling with a syringe. As they step out of the shadow, you can make out their face, the roguishly handsome Crixx. He positions a large surgical headlight above you and turns it on. He holds up the large syringe to the light and chuckles, staring into your pleading eyes.
“Don't worry, it will all be over soon”
He removes his mask to reveal his serpent's tongue, flickering in amusement. He plunges the syringe straight through your “skull is lock prio” shirt into your arm.
“Nighty night”
Your world fades to black once more.
