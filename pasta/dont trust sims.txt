Dont trust sims. Think about it, all these years of wow there was no sim for vanilla and tbc warlocks and now suddenly shady coders and "mathematicians" that call themself "Hildi" "Zephan" and "Jpaint" show up and are trying to tell us that they have it all figured out. "Gem sp/crit", "dont gem haste" what is next, we use searing pain instead of shadowbolt? Dont trust these snake oil salesmen. The reason we didnt have sims back then was because what mattered most was having fun and doing what you felt was right, not to trust and chase arbitrary numbers made up by some excel sheet.
