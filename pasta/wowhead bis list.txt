The wowhead bis list is popular because it’s wowhead, that’s all. I’m sure it’s the first thing that pops up in google.

I had a chance yesterday to talk to the bis list creator about it. I left a comment on the list on wowhead and he was obviously a little bit pissed off by my criticism, but politely asked me to message him on discord about it. Later that night, in bed, as he lit a cigarette, I strummed my fingers across his bare chest and reminded him about my question earlier. He placed his fingers over my lips and whispered into my ear “How can I think about bis lists when I have this on my mind all day?” as he slapped my ass before forcing his lips onto mine.
