I used to hate Min Maxing but, I've learned its so much more fun then being a casual. I'll admit I'm becoming a tad bit elitist. I'm nowhere near an impressive number but, I'm always improving. People should treat this game as a job tbh. Because raiding is a job. A fun job but, a job none the less.
