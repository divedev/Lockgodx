In a shocking turn of events, new information has come to light indicating a widespread conspiracy within the leadership of the Classic WoW Warlock Discord. Previously thought to be a bastion of purple bois, now home to mages hidden in plain sight.

Our investigative reports searched through warcraftlogs to discover, shockingly, that a large portion of the admins and mods are actually mage players. The conspiracy was discovered when Crix, a mage player from EU-Patchwerk and admin on the discord, promoted Ryusei, a mage from CN, to the role of "Warlock Trainer".

Other members on the discord implicated include Jpaint, a mage from US-Benediction and Dive, a mage from CN.
