I was in Phoenix God for a month as a trial warlock but left after I realized how the guild is structuredâ€”the entire raid exists just to fuel his parse. My first week he looted the illidan healing cloak to himself for his seed set instead of giving it to a healer that needed it. By week 2 of raiding with them I had an assignment as a backup isb stacker in case the other lock didn't use it. Week 3 I was asked to use rank 3 sbolt to put isb on the boss after imp elements was applied for his parse. Week 4 he sent out an announcement saying that all warlocks were required to try and farm ribbon of the skyguard so that he could put people with it in his group and have them spam only clockwork bots the whole fight to try and proc the buffs for him. It was the type of guild where if he got silenced on anetheron he'd make the whole raid wait up to 48 hours just so he could run SSC to get the neckpiece.
