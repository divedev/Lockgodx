Jpaint: You're awful, Mayhem.

Mayhem: Me? I’m awful? Oh yeah, how am I awful?

Jpaint: Saying I smell. Inviting me on the locktalk. You just wanted to make fun of my sims. You’re just like the rest of them!

Mayhem: You don’t know the first thing about me, pal. Look what happened because of what you simmed, what it led to. There are crit gems being gemmrd out there. Two healer cloaks are in critical condition, and you’re laughing, you’re laughing. Someone was gkicked today because of what you simmed.

Jpaint: I know! How about another sim, Mayhem?

Mayhem: No, I think we’ve had enough of your sims.

Jpaint: What do you get…

Mayhem: I don’t think so.

Jpaint: …when you cross a high parsing warlock with a discord that abandons him and treats him like trash!?

Mayhem: Call the mods, Ryusei, call the mods.

Jpaint: I’ll tell you what you get! You get what you fucking deserve!
