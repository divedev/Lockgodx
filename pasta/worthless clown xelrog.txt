if you have some worthless clown like xelrog who just talks out of his ass trying to drown my objectively correct statements in his baseless bullshit, or you have a server admin that isnt even playing the game claiming "gemming is super easy, youre not contributing with providing gemming" while his warlock trainer has been corrected by me on gemming on multiple occasions and needed to have his eyes opened by me about ruby drape because he doesnt understand gemming/spellhit and is here and now wearing a straight up inferior setup compared to one with better gearing and gemming (with item he does own), then yes I will not let them portray me as the clown that I am not
