Two years of fucking curse of elements? TWO FUCKING YEARS of prioritizing shit fucked hellfire & mage damage over my phat shadowy ICBM's that hit with the force of a thousand suns? They can't even support us now because they want a talent that makes them OOM FASTER? Fuck the mages. Mages are communists who sit on their asses all day waiting for a pittance of the holy ignite on their warcraftlogs profile. Two years of 'oops I pulled aggro, guess fire's OP'. Now we get this shit? No scorch mage? Arcane P4? The mages can suck my dick. Its time for a two year reign of terror where the enslaved mage shills support us. I will make it my personal objective to tap until healers need innervate and the mages cry.
