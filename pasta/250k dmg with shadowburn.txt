I deal about 250k damage with shadowburn in a bt run when I brought enough shards, which everyone should, thats 1 million damage for 4 warlocks which is not something to laugh at, and now apply the same way of "thinking" to everyone else in the raid using finisher moves like mage flame blast or ele shocks, its a fair amount of damage in total, Id say at least 2% of the raid's total damage actually, also mobs living awkwardly long is very weird and annoying, you can just run 2 28 slot soul bags, I do it, not an issue, if you dont like it you can put them into the bank after the raid, Ive made it a habit to start raids with both bags filled plus some. Its a good habit to have and it also helps me mentally to be bringing this many soul shards to the raid because running low on shards feels very bad, its an actual horror to be honest. Having to say "Im out of shards" or even imply that youre low on shards is very embarrassing, this affects the performance I can display in the raid aswell. It also affects the performance of everyone else too. Its a lot better feeling to be raiding for everyone involved knowing the warlocks are bringing so many soul shards they cant possibly run low. Its just that feeling of confidence and empowerment you get knowing youre raiding with competent warlocks. Its an aspect many overlook. My best shadowburns deal almost 6k damages, its a significant amount of damage, many shadow bolts end up dealing less damage than that, even crits sometimes. Also this way youre making sure all isb stacks are getting used up before the mob dies which feels very nice. I always hate it to see those precious stacks go to waste. Seeing that a lot less by shadowburning helps my mental. Also helps the mental of everyone in the raid seeing the stacks used up efficiently. Again its a nice thing to have in the raid, warlocks which are confident. Just makes you feel better about the raid and you play better. I for one am pro shadowburning whenever its a dps gain.
