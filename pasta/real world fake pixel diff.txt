Foolipe what actual real world fake pixels dps difference are you even going to get from "crafting Mantle of nimble thought"? You can seed differently and then there are MAYBE 2 whole items you can swap based on which religion of seed set you're following. The difference will be 20 dps if even that. You have been MALDING about Mantle of mumble thought ever since christmas holidays began. Can you even imagine how much dps you could have been gaining in all that time by trying to get in depth understandings of trash mechanics in p3 and finding the optimal way to seed them as a warlock? There are always little things you can do that others aren't thinking of and often they will make way more than 20 dps difference. Even on trash like pre vashj trash I have seen up to 300 dps difference in warlock dps (same gear, pressing seed) that came just from seeding the encounter well vs seeding it poorly. Why are you for example not discussing the ideal split second decisions to make when being affected by hyjal gargoyles (eg run to teepee, seed harder). Running to the teepee equals to a lot more dps than crafting the mantle of nimble thought you would have met had you ran to the tepee. Another thing is pre casting seed. Are you even pre casting seed? As per simulations pre casting seed deals 25 dps. And here you are discussing things that will maybe make 10 dps difference, while probably not pre seeding always. It would be the more efficient pre cast seed rather than spending your time here crafting Mantle of nimble thought. Honestly, just for the sake of discussion efficiency, anyone who cant provide a weekly screenshot of pre seeding should be banned from discussion in this channel. The ignorance about the dps efficiency of discussions has been going too far. All you "profession levelers" are literally doing is crafting Mantle of nimble thought. Practical seeding is what crafts actual mastery and dps results.
